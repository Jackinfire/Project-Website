These markers appear to rise in advance of asthmatic patients being aware of an impending crisis and could therefore have therapeutic uses in indicating when patients should take their medication.  In addition, Scheller's group have been able to detect lactic acid in breath condensate which correlates to some degree with blood lactate levels.

The collection of most biological samples is necessarily invasive and the high protein content interferes with-most analytical techniques, so if therapeutic or bioanalytically useful data can be obtained from breath condensate, this is an attractive proposition.

We propose a project for 1-2 students to design and build a portable instrument for collecting and analysing breath condensate and aerosols.  There are at least two parts: (i)sample collection and handling to ensure reproducible volumes and (ii) development of electrochemical sensors for analysing the samples and comparison with chromatographic analysis.  A very hands-on lab an workshop based project."

Mainstream data analysis tools such as the Fourier transform are not valid since the signals are non-linear.  There is a particular difficulty measuring neurotransmitters- many monoamines have similar redox potentials.  We have developed numerical models of the sensors that allow extraction of the physico-chemical properties (redox potential, rate constant, diffusion coefficient etc) to enable more positive identification.

It is generally agreed that it is associated with the closure of the aortic valve and it is used clinically to divide the cardiac cycle into systole and diastole. However, despite its clinical importance, the detailed mechanisms involved are not clear. The project would involve the collection of high fidelity intra-arterial pressure and velocity waveforms at different locations in the arterial system. These waveforms will then be analysed using wave intensity analysis with the goal of determining the mechanical processes in the production of the dicrotic notch.

The project could also involve laboratory measurements in a mock circulation incorporating an artificial 'heart' valve. This would involve the setting up of the flow system, the measurement of flow and pressure waveforms and the analysis of these waveforms using wave intensity analysis. The balance of experimental and theoretical analysis in the project is negotiable."

Super shoes‚Äù with carbon-fibre plates and stiff midsoles are engineered to improve running efficiency by enhancing energy return. However, there is growing concern that increased stiffness may alter load distribution and increase injury risk, particularly in the ankle and metatarsals.
This project will use FEA to simulate how varying midsole stiffness, both with and without embedded carbon plates, affects the distribution of stress and strain in the foot during stance phase loading. Both static and dynamic simulation will be considered.
Key research questions are whether increased stiffness shifts stress concentrations to injury-prone regions (e.g. the ankle or metatarsals), and what may be the trade-off between performance gains and biomechanical safety.

Having taken BACSA in Y3 is a pre-requisite.

We want to model thermal conductivity through tissue. We have preliminary models for the neck and the thigh. We have two applications; 
1) lower limb prosthetics can be quite uncomfortable as they act as insulators eg when running or when it's hot and the body wants to cool the down. Having a model of how temperature builds up (muscle heating up) and tries to cool down (perspiration) can help us design better prosthetics to reduce the thermal insulation they cause. 
2) delivering a thermal stimulation to specific location can trigger thermal receptors in the spinal cord and make the body cool down in cases of unwanted heat build up due to administration of specific drugs. We want to model the heat transfer from the stimulation to the thermal receptors and figure out what stimulation regime(s) could be optimal.

A simple mechanical surrogate to test the FE model for validation will also be part of this project.

The reason for this is that stable electrophysiological recordings from nerve cells are only possible if there is no relative movement between the recording electrode and the nerve cell.  While this approach has successfully been used to discover some general principles of sensory information processing, it has two fundamental limitations: (i) under natural conditions the animal simultaneously receives input from virtually all of its sensor systems, and (ii) it generated motor commands (efference copies) which may modify the way in which sensor signals are being processed. 
 
To approximate more realistic conditions when monitoring neuronal activities in the fly nervous system the animal will be mounted on a robot that is free to move in the laboratory environment. The action potentials of motion sensitive interneurons in the fly visual system will be recorded and used to control the steering of the robot, establishing a closed-loop fly-robot interface. This configuration will allow the experimenter to selectively disable individual sensor systems to assess their respective impact on multisensory integration in the fly nervous system.

This project is dedicated the necessary miniaturization of electrophysiological equipment, e.g. amplifier circuits, so it can be mounted on a mobile robot platform to record the neural signals of identified optic flow processing interneurons. The recorded signals will be filtered and converted into command commands for the robot steering. The resulting feed-back system will be set up in a way that prevents the robot from colliding with any obstacles in its immediate environment.

Biopolymers, such as actin filaments, microtubules and protein amyloid fibrils distinguish themselves from typical materials in that they are almost perfectly crystalline. In other words, there are no weak points in a biopolymer. How a biopolymer breaks, either under tension or due to thermal fluctuations, is therefore very much an open question. And a better understanding of how breakage occurs will have important implications on cellular biomechanics. 

In this project, the student will investigate this problem by performing numerical simulations of a toy model of biopolymers.

The calculation of wave intensity requires the simultaneous measurement of pressure and velocity which is generally done by inserting a catheter into the artery - a very invasive procedure. Recent advances in fast MR scanning has opened the possibility of measuring coronary artery velocity non-invasively. At the same time, standard imaging scans can determine the area of the aorta which is related to the pressure. This means that it should now be possible to calculate wave intensity in the coronary arteries non-invasively.

The project will be collaborative with the CMR Unit at the Royal Brompton Hospital. There are many facets of the overall project which could form the student project depending on interest, expertise and time available. Some of the possible project areas are image analysis, signal analysis, processing of patient data and more fundamental studies of MR signal acquisition. "

The search for non-invasive tools for the diagnosis and management of cancer has led to great interest in the field of circulating nucleic acids in plasma, serum and urine. Among the potential biomarker candidates, tumour-derived micro RNAs (miRNAs), a class of non-coding RNAs of 19-25 nucleotides in length, are emerging as novel fingerprints for the diagnosis and prognosis of human cancers. Because of the lack of sensitivity and/or reliably of the existing optical methods for the profiling of these miRNAs (e.g. qPCR), we are aiming to develop an ultrasensitive and minimally invasive electrochemical technology for the screening of multiple miRNAs in serum, plasma, saliva or urine.

Ladame has demonstrated a novel fluorescence based detection strategy for sensing miRNAs in various biological fluids. It uses a combination of two complementary hybridization probes based on a synthetic peptide nucleic acid (PNA) scaffold.  PNAs show higher binding affinity, specificity and chemical robustness than more commonly used DNA or RNA probes making them attractive for application in diagnostics.  Simultaneous binding of both probes (Figure 1) leads to a Michael-type addition of a thiol from one probe to the quenched coumarin on the second probe, leading to restoration of the fluorescence signal.  In this project we propose to investigate extension of this technology to electrochemical detection.  Electrochemical methods are low cost, easily implemented in portable point-of-care devices and scale well to extreme miniaturization.

Core to our proposal is the immobilization of electrochemically active quinone-labelled PNAs on the surface of BDD.  Binding of the miRNA target followed by the second thiol-labelled probe will facilitate a 1,4 addition reaction at the quinone which can be detected from the change in redox properties.  The principle of this scheme is shown in Figure 2.  Potential advantages of this wholly novel approach include the ability to switch off the reaction by reducing the quinone to the hydroquinone, enabling background drift corrections to be implemented prior to measurement.

Different electrode materials ranging from boron-doped diamond to graphite inks will be assessed for suitability and electrochemical properties of quinoid moieties and kinetic parameters of the reacting base will inform development of a prototype device.  In addition to the electrochemical and chemical optimisation, possibly by numerical modelling, signal acquisition and data processing could form part of this project."

This extraordinary property of regeneration is far from fully understood. Recent advances have revealed that the cells at the edge of the wound are not the only active players in the healing process, rather, cells deep in the bulk exhibit active motility forces [1], and large scale swirling patterns [2]. The highly dynamic nature of tissue under regeneration suggests the possibility of viewing wound healing as a collective movement of a fluid under self-generated stress (due to cell motility) and self-generated pressure (due to cell division). This perspective has recently been investigated using computer simulations which were able to capture some of the salient features of experimental observations [3]. To render the model more realistic, a number of the model assumptions need to be connected to actual biological processes. Further, a comprehensive verification of the model requires derivable predictions that can be validated by experiments. In this project, we will first construct a cell proliferation model by incorporating elements of cell adhesion, motility and proliferation common to epithelial cells. We will then employ simulation methods to study how tissue regeneration would proceed for different types of tissue damages. For instance, we will investigate how the shape of the finger-like protrusions from the edges of the wound varies with the shape of the wound. This project will lead to an in-depth understanding of the biophysical mechanisms behind wound healing, and will equip the student with the computational skills to model cell proliferation in diverse contexts.

It is a Collaboration between the Boutelle group, the Drakakis Group and Prof Chris Shaw (Maurice Wahl Clinical Research Centre, King;s College Hospital). ALS is a devastating disease that is characterised by rapid deterioration in motor function leading typically to death within a few years of diagnosis. Development of therapies is hampered by the lack of a reliable method of determining the progression of the disease. Typically clinical function assessments are used, but the scale is too corse and too subjective to allow evaluation of drug therapies that might for example slow the rate of disease progression.
We have been following a different approach, where we use multiple skin contact to record EMG's from pairs of major muscle groups in the arms or legs of a patient. We are looking for complex fasciculation that seem to be characteristic of ALS. 
There are two stands of the project; the first is to develop wearable clothing that can reliably hold the contact onto the skin to allow longer recording to be made outside of the clinical consultation. The second is to develop pattern recognition algorithms  to group ALS fasciculation potentials to allow processing of large volumes of data. this is particularly important as the project now aims for patient self monitoring at home.

The fibrotic microenvironment is characterised by an increased stiffness, with rigidity associated with disease progression. External stiffness is known to promote hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation through mechanotransduction, leading to increased secretion of ECM components. HSCs are key effector cells which maintain the composition of the ECM in health and disease, not only by regulating secretion of ECM proteins such as collagen, but also ECM-degrading enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs). Uninhibited MMPs degrade ECM proteins to reduce external rigidity. Using fibronectin-coated polyacrylamide gels to alter substrate rigidity without altering ligand density, we showed before that fibrotic rigidities downregulate MMP-9 expression and secretion, and also upregulate secretion of TIMP-1, though not its expression.

The student will use fibronectin-coated polyacrylamide gels to alter substrate rigidity and study the molecular mechanisms that underpin the effects described above in Hepatic Stellate cells.

The aim of this study is to develop a portable system using a multi channel microphone array and these algorithms to improve the audio output of hearing aid.
An algorithm has been developed to calculate the direction of arrival of the main speech signal, using generalised cross correlation methods, and to shape and steer a beam accordingly, using a simple fixed beamforming technique. Algorithms were written in MATLAB and then JAVA for implementation on an Android tablet in order to produce a controllable and understandable output for hearing aid users.  These could now be converted to run on a laptop with the USB microphone array. Prototype USB microphones are on loan from their developer/manufacturer.

The steps required are now:
	Develop software to:	
o	capture the sound signals from the microphones, singly and as an array, and develop methods to store these.
o	Process the incoming array sound signals by applying Direction of Arrival processing to identify multiple sound sources.
o	Develop an interactive User Interface which displays on-screen (touch screen?) the range of sources identified and their direction from the user/array
o	Interactively allow the user to select one of these as the preferred source to amplify
o	Apply Beamforming  to process the sound signal, and output the processed sound to captive headphones/earpieces

Among them, non-coding microRNAs (or miRNAs) are frequently found to be upregulated or down-regulated in body fluids and have great potential as novel blood-based fingerprints, e.g. for the early detection of cancer. However, because of their complexity and cost, current gold-standards for microRNA detection (e.g RT-qPCR) are unsuitable for point-of-care testing and can only be carried out by trained professionals in equipped laboratories. One of their main shortcomings is their inability to provide clear answers from whole blood without heavy processing which, in the absence of standardised procedures, is a major source of errors and variation between analyses.
Herein, we are proposing to engineer and test a broad range of denaturing hydrogels capable of efficiently extracting miRNAs from whole blood, focusing on their ability to i) release miRNAs bounds to proteins and/or trapped in exosomes and ii) isolate those small RNA oligonucleotides by size exclusion.

Designing and developing new microscopy tools is therefore of widespread interest, but techniques for simulating optical propagation are either precise but computationally inefficient, or efficient but crude. Small-scale phenomena can be accurately simulated using high-precision finite element methods, which accurately account for diffraction effects, polarization, and nonlinearily, but simulating a microscope objective using these methods is infeasible. Large-scale simulation methods such as ray-tracing can handle macroscopic features, but these simplify the propagation of light considerably, meaning that the user must exercise good judgement when interpreting the results of the simulation.
In many optical systems, the propagation through bulk media, such as glass or air, dominate the computational time of the simulation, and as such dramatic time savings can be made by identifying these large, homogeneous regions and not simulating their contents.
The student on this project will work on approaches to segment an arbitrary space into a computationally-tractable volume, as well as approaches to combine the finite element simulation with the free-space propagation simulations.

Fortunately, many applications are parallelizable; motion tracking can be performed with multiple cameras simultaneously, hyperspectral imaging can capture all wavelengths in parallel, and so on.

One important limitation of conventional projection-based optics is that the change is induced by a single photon. This has a subtle problem in 3D applications, because if one wishes to confine the photo-response to a particular plane, the regions above and below the plane are also illuminated.
This is a particular problem in optogenetics, a cutting-edge technique in which light is used to excite neurons in the brain. Here, it is desirable to excite one neuron but not the ones above or below, yet this is impossible with conventional optical projection. Fortunately, there is a potential solution - one can use high-speed projectors to make holograms that change very rapidly. None of the projected images are intense enough to trigger a neuron on their own, but the sum of many of them is. One can therefore find a series of patterns that trigger the desired cell, but cause the light above and below the desired cell to 'miss' the important regions, thus having no effect.
The student for this project will work on developing an algorithm that can, for a given distribution of neurons, find a sequence of holograms that trigger a single cell but don't affect the surrounding cells.

Novel research is highlighting the important role that biomechanics play in tumour development, complementing the latter's well documented biochemical underpinnings. Biophysical cues such as tissue rigidity have already been established as regulators of tumour cell behaviour. However, mechanical stress has recently been found to elicit far-reaching effects on tumour progression that are distinct from other cues. This project contributes to efforts to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which mechanical stress evolution influences tumour progression.   
	 
Project Aims (max. 250 words)
 
Due to a lack of suitable techniques, studies investigating the effect of mechanical stresses on tumour behaviour have not been capable of accurately characterising the tumour-induced stress field in vivo. Apart from a consequent lack of an accurate experimental basis, this also precludes the correlation of stress evolution with specific tumourigenic events such as the onset of metastasis. As such, the aim of this project is to develop a novel technique that enables the accurate and dynamic measurement of mechanical stresses originating in both the fluid and solid domain of a tumour. Techniques may range from mechanical to optics based, or others.
	 
Research Plan (max. 250 words)
 
The applicant is to develop an in-depth knowledge of the origins of elevated mechanical stresses observed in tumours. Subsequently, current methods of quantifying tumour-induced stresses are to be reviewed so as to identify limitations in the state of the art. Based on these findings, the applicant is to design and develop a novel technique which addresses these shortcomings. As part of the design process, the stress measurement technique is also to be validated and ultimately demonstrate its ability to map intratumoural stresses with unprecedented accuracy.

Earlier studies in blowflies have revealed the underlying neuronal mechanism which is believed to complement state change estimation based on mechanosensory/inertial systems.
 
This project aims to support the idea that optic flow processing in the visual system of flying insects is tuned to control species-specific natural modes of motion which are determined by the animal's flight dynamics. Experimental evidence in support for the mode sensing hypothesis requires a comparative study of the receptive field properties of motion sensitive interneurons in the visual systems of other than dipteran flies, e.g. species belonging to the order of orthopteran, odonata and lepidoptera.
 
Hoverflies, which show distinctly different flight patterns than blowflies and also perform differently in behavioural gaze stabilization experiments, would be an ideal candidate species. Preliminary experiments have shown that hoverflies, too, employ motion sensitive interneurons in their visual system. But only one such interneuron has been studied so far. 

This project requires the dissection of flying insect species for extracellular recordings upon visual motion stimuli. The neuronal responses will be analysed using customized MATLAB/Python programmes which reveal the cell's receptive field organization. From the electrophysiological results the preference of individually identifiable interneurons for specific self-motion components (state changes) will be derived.

One important behavioural output parameter is the difference between the left and the right wing beat amplitude, delta WB. In the fruitfly Drosophila, it has been shown that delta WB is proportional to the torque the animal generates when following the direction of visual motion to minimize retinal image motion. 
This project aims to build a so-called 'wingbeat analyzer' which enables the measurement of delta WB. It is based on the difference between the output signals of two photodiods that are differentialy illuminated due to different wing beat amplitudes either side of the animal. 

The wing beat analyzer will enable simultaneous measurements of a behavioural output parameter, delta WB, and the neuronal signals contributing to its control. Ultimately, the project is relevant for the development of novel bio-inspired control architectures  applied to autonomous robotics.     "

Both come from a long term collaboration with Prof Anthony Strong and his team at King;s College Hospital NHS Trust. In the past we have demonstrated the importance of Spreading depolarisations (SDs)in the development of secondary brain injury in patients who have had a severe traumatic brain injury. This project involves working with the field potential data streams we obtain from out patients. The distinction between this project and MGB1911 is that in this project work focusses on what are called direct cortical responses (DCR). If we send out a single stimulus pulse of sufficient power it will cause neighbouring neurones to respond by firing back once. the power required reflects the resting state of those neurons. In the brain of a TBI patient this is perhaps the only way we can get an unbiased measurement of how destabilised this brain tissue is by the injury. Preliminary data indicates that we can track the level of tissue injury in real-time whist patients are in a drug induced coma.

The project  has the possibility of visits to the Hospital (if allowed) to see the clinical team together with working with project members in MGB group . In particular Sharon Jewel, a n MRC training fellowt from the MGB group and expert in neurophysiology.

A screening method that can detect the limited number of cancer cells circulating in the blood would be of interest in these cases.

Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting, or FACS, is a routinely-used method for sorting cells into different categories based on fluorescence. Unfortunately, cancer cells aren't fluorescent, and finding a good label is arduous and often ineffective. The alternative is to use some form of intrinsic contrast, such as the Raman effect. The Raman effect allows molecules to be identified by the characteristic vibrational frequencies of the bonds in the molecule itself, thus it is very specific and requires no labelling or staining. The goal of this project is to take the first steps towards a combined Raman-Activated Cell Sorting (RACS) and single-cell sequencing instrument that can identify rare circulating tumour cells early.

The student on this project will first be responsible for designing, building and programming a Raman microspectrometer, and then using it to analyse different cell populations (some made up of known cancer cells, some not) to see whether the system can distinguish an individual cancer cell from the thousands of other cells also found in the blood.

Microfluidics has great promise, particularly for small-scale syntheses, in that it can perform reactions more rapidly, under more tightly controlled and uniform conditions, and in an entirely automated manner. Unfortunately, chip designs for one reaction cannot be easily modified or used for another reaction, which limits flexibility. This new microfluidic chip will be able to emulate any other design, changing reaction conditions and configuration rapidly and easily, ushering in a new era of microfluidic drug synthesis.

The formation of this fibrous tissue is driven by pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), which are cells that remodel the tissue architecture by secreting extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules and applying physical forces. To be active these cells need to adopt a phenotype that the knowledge base group previously demonstrated to be modulated by substrate stiffness. 
PDAC tissues are very stiff and acidic, which means that PSCs and cancer cells are exposed to rigid surfaces with very low pH levels. No matrices are available to study in vitro how cancer cells and cells surrounding the tumour behave in stiff and acid environments. Our laboratory is working in partnership with the company Manchester BIOGEL that provides us with  matrices that can simultaneously tune mechanical and biochemical ECM properties.
Project aims: 
The main goal of this project is to use these matrices to investigate the mechanical behaviour of cancer cells in four conditions varying pH and rigidity (soft/neutral, soft/acid, stiff/neutral, stiff/acid). The student will study effect of low pH and stiffness in survival, proliferation and invasive properties of cancer cells.

Approximately 400 million adults have a diabetes diagnosis, and around 15 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed worldwide each year. Accumulating observational and experimental evidence suggests that these two diseases are linked, and epidemiological data support an association between T2D and elevated risk of cancer at several anatomical sites. However, major questions regarding the pathophysiology underlying these relationships remain unanswered. There are many predisposing DNA variants shared between T2D and different cancers suggesting common aetiologic pathways. Moreover, our preliminary data indicates that some cancer genetic loci are associated with metabolic abnormalities that predispose to T2D, including hyperinsulinaemia and dyslipidaemia.

Project hypothesis:
T2D and cancer share a number of heritable factors and may have common pathophysiology in their aetiology.
 
The project will aim to elucidate potential shared predisposition underlying the relationships between these diseases, through the following objectives:
1. To elucidate the extent of overlap and mechanistic relationships between DNA variants and contributing to T2D susceptibility and T2D-related traits including hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia, and three common malignancies - colorectal, prostate and postmenopausal breast cancer.
2. To determine whether T2D and related metabolic/metabolomic traits are causally related to colorectal, prostate and postmenopausal breast cancer using a Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach.

Methods:
The project will implement a comprehensive cross-disciplinary investigation of T2D and cancer that utilises the rich multi-omic resources of large international genetic consortia and the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, including 26,000 individuals with multi-omic data. Through public resources and EPIC data, the mechanistic relationships between DNA variants influencing the risk of T2D and colorectal, prostate and breast cancers, and affecting  cardiometabolic/metabolomic trait variability will be investigated. MR approaches will be implemented using polygenic risk scores to dissect the causal T2D and related metabolic/metabolomic traits-cancer relationships.

Outcomes:
This project will help identification of clinically-relevant novel omics-based cancer-T2D biomarkers through reduction in cancer mortality and will lead to improved approaches in precision medicine."

To date, VNS has successfully been used to treat epilepsy by continually sending impulses down the vagus nerve from the ear in order to effectively cancel out the epileptic signals from the brain. However, this approach was not informed by measurements taken from the nerve, and as such had numerous side effects, due to the always-on approach taken by the stimulator.

Work performed by Professor Chris Toumazou et al has shown that a pH-sensitive electrode can be combined with a microcontroller and electrical stimulator to create a closed-loop system that can measure vagus nerve activity in the form of pH changes (which in turn is caused by certain appetite regulating hormones, like CCK, being detected by the nerve), and stimulate the nerve to control the magnitude of the neural response. This work was performed in rats, and the next phase of research will be conducted in pigs, in preparation for clinical testing.

Applying machine learning techniques to the problem of deciding how to interpret and act upon the chemical (pH level) signal that the electrode detects could be a promising area of study. Particularly, a model that had been trained on data collected during the rat study could be applied, with minimal retraining, to the signal produced by the chip implanted in pigs, thereby reducing the amount of data that needs to be collected before a similarly accurate model could be replicated to work with the signal from the pigs. Indeed, the practice of applying a trained model in another, similar, area is a common one in the machine learning field.

The aim of this project would be twofold: first, train a model based on data collected in rats. The model would take in raw data from the pH-sensitve electrode, presumably in the form of voltages. The model would be trained to produce an electrical signal, that is the signal that the stimulator should produce to induce in the vagus nerve to cancel out the hunger signal. The second part of the project would be to take this trained model and apply it to the data taken from the sensor implanted in pigs, with the goal of retraining it to produce similarly correct signals in the pig system. This could lay the groundwork for applying the same principles to data from later, clinical studies.

In cases of  Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS), the left ventricle and aorta are undersized and under-developed, and surgical reconstruction is often undertaken to provide the patient with a ventricle of adequate size to deliver the pumping required, and a larger aorta is constructed.  
However, imaging these vulnerable babies (especially tiny neonates) is not without risk and therefore images and models of the aortic anatomy (normal and pathological) are not available. Surgical reconstruction must thus be based on estimates rather than known geometries.

Anthrax is a powerful bioweapon not only due to its pathogenicity, but because it can form spores which are extremely difficult to eradicate. These spores are stable for decades, and are resistant to radiation, ultraviolet light, dessication, extreme heat and cold, as well as a number of chemical disinfectants. Identification and detection of these spores is critical to decontamination of an area after a suspected attack, but for obvious reasons, it is not a good idea for a user to get too close to a suspected contamination. Finding a way to detect these spores at ranges of 10m and above would be extremely beneficial for first-responders who wouldn't have to risk their lives to test a suspected release site.
One way to perform this detection is using Raman microscopy. The student on this project will be responsible for building a system to perform Raman detection at long distances, without compromising on sensitivity.

This ability has been shown fundamental for several important biological functions like lumen formation during sprouting angiogenesis [1] or aqueous humor intraocular pressure regulation [2]. In these processes,  endothelial cells are subjected to large hydrodynamic pressure gradients to which they respond by forming fluid-filled membrane invaginations. Around these structures actin filaments and myosin motors are recruited to construct an active contractile shell that sustains the vacuole. At large times the vacuoles are observed to collapse, which is likely caused by the formation of a second pore at the top of the vacuole through which the internal chamber pressure is released. This complex behaviour has been hypothesized to be the characteristic cellular response to large pressure gradients [1], but the biophysical mechanisms underlying it are currently under investigation. In this project, the Candidate will contribute to the formulation of a biophysical model of this phenomenon, called inverse blebbing. Two main research topics are available: (i) understanding the vacuole collapse process through modelling of the membrane pore formation within the framework of active gel theory [3]; (b) understanding the initial invagination dynamics and formulating a suitable stochastic model of it. The Candidate will be required to learn some basics of elasticity theory and to perform both analytical and numerical calculations.

It requires no labelling of the sample, is extremely specific, and applicable to almost any compound imaginable. Given these virtues, it is fair to ask why it is not more ubiquitous in medical diagnosis, and the answer is that it is painfully slow. Spontaneous Raman microscopy takes around a second to collect even a low-quality spectrum, and this is simply too slow as a tool for mapping tissue, or screening cells. Finding a way to speed the process up would be ideal.

In this project you will be exploring techniques to speed up Raman microscopy, for example by using parallel excitation, light-sheet imaging, electron-multiplying CCDs, high-power lasers or high-performance signal-processing methods.

More recent designs such as the Microsoft Hololens and Magic Leap One use holographic gratings to project light into the eye, but these have a smaller field of view, leading to the 'toilet roll' problem described above.

The Rowlands lab is currently developing a new type of holographic display, which can achieve a large field of view along with high resolution, by making the hologram itself active, rather than passive. Instead of projecting the whole image at once, the display scans a beam across the eye at high speeds, producing the illusion of high resolution but without the compromises needed for the Hololens or Magic Leap One.

Recently an intriguing class of organelles lacking a membrane is being studied intensely. Membrane-less organelles have attracted an intense interest from the biology community as they are present in many organisms from yeast to mammal cells, and are critical for multiple biological functions. For example, P granules are involved in the asymmetric division of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, and stress granules assemble during environmental stress and protect cytoplasmic RNA from degradation. Strong experimental evidence indicates that membrane-less organelles are assembled via liquid√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúliquid phase separation, a common phenomenon in everyday life responsible for example for oil drop formation in water. Under the equilibrium condition phase separation is well understood. However cells are driven away from equilibrium by multiple energy consuming processes such as ATP-driven protein phosphorylation, which can potentially affect the phase-separating behavior of membrane-less constituents. In this project, we will study how these energy-consuming processes affect the dynamics of phase separation in the context of the cell cytoplasm."

It has been observed that parameters of the dog such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and position all characteristically change in response to target detection. If these can be monitored and analysed to classify different olfactory recognition events when smelling for trained odours, a more accurate target determination method could be achieved that would rely less on subjective interpretations from the handler.
The aim of this project is to develop a wearable monitoring system that can track key vital signs and deliver classified feedback to the handler. This project consists of multiple elements: the student will have the opportunity to work on PCB design, sensor interfacing, and machine learning using multiple input types (heart rate and motion) to classify olfactory recognition events.

Furthermore, it is the main area of failure of the prosthesis and replacement is a time-consuming process that requires the amputee to visit the limb fitting centre so that their prosthesis is heavily modified and a new foot is fitted.

Asthma is rare in rural societies, and its prevalence has been increasing markedly in the developing world as populations become urbanised. Exacerbations of asthma are often precipitated by otherwise trivial viral infections. Our studies have shown that the normal human airways contain a characteristic microbiome that is altered in children and adults with the illness. Asthmatic airways contain an excess of pathogens (which may damage the airways) and also lack particular commensal species that may be necessary for normal airway functions.

A common signature of amyloid-related pathogenesis is the gradual replacement of healthy tissue by aggregates of amyloid fibrils (e.g., in the form of amyloid plaque (AP) in AD), resulting in the degradation of the functioning of the tissue. Amyloid fibrils are insoluble biopolymers that are robust against proteolysis, and their presence in the forms of extracellular AP and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles are the defining histopathologic features of AD. However, mounting evidence has indicated that proteins in the monomeric form and oligomeric form, instead of proteins in the fibrillar form, are predominantly responsible for cell death. This finding thus raises the conundrum of the role of amyloid fibrils in amyloid pathogenesis: Since monomers have a tendency to self-assemble into amyloid fibrils, fibril formation should be a good way to sequester monomers and oligomers in the system by locking them up into the fibrillar form. Unfortunately, evidence points to the contrary, as demonstrated by the facts that injecting fibrils into transgenic mice induces the onset of amyloid pathogenesis and the well documented cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease resulting from ingesting the misfolded form of prion proteins. In other words, there is a disconnect with the histopathologic characterisation of AD and our understanding of the cell-death inducing mechanism at the molecular level. 

Physically, amyloid fibrilisation and AP formation are well-described by the physics of aggregation [1]. Separately, there are well-developed methods to model toxicity-induced cell death. This project thus aims to combine these two distinct fields to further our understanding of Alzheimers disease pathogenesis.

This observation confirms that soil fungi redistribute water along gradients in water potential through their hyphal networks and represents the first account of these events on the microscale. The observed phenomenon of water transport through hyphal networks has important consequences regarding the migration of soil bacteria into new microhabitats. Indeed, we expect this interdisciplinary research study to contribute fundamental knowledge to the current fungal highways dispersion theory, which states that hyphal networks provide a platform for the active movement of bacteria in soil (Kohlmeier et al., ES&T, 2005). 

We are developing microfluidic or ""Lab-on-a-Chip"" technologies to probe the interplay between soil-dwelling organisms and roots at the single cell level. This technique has a great potential to provide a unique view of biological events at the level of single organisms and cells by enabling precise environmental control, high-resolution dynamic imaging, the simulation of environmental complexity and affording quantitative information. In this project, you will use a microfluidic platform to direct and constrain the growth of fungal cultures, making it possible to study water transport through hyphal networks at the cellular level. Specifically, the so-called fungal-fungal interaction (FFI) device (Gimeo, Stanley et al., Commun. Biol., 2020, under review) and adaptations thereof will be used to culture fungal hyphae and assess the influence of fungal species on the role of water transport through hyphal networks using novel microfluidic technology.

You will gain experience with microfluidic device manufacture, microscopy, microbiology, data analysis, designing experiments, statistical analysis, scientific writing and doing science

As this mass-manufacturing technology underpins the production of pharmaceuticals worldwide, there is considerable interest in achieving even modest gains in efficiency and yield which, when scaled out over a large-scale manufacturing process, contribute to dramatic cost-savings. Unfortunately, if optimising a chemical reactor is hard (with all the inhomogeneities in temperature, pressure, reagent concentration and so on), optimising a bioreactor is much harder still, because cells are much more sensitive to their local environment. Fortunately, researchers in the Polizzi lab in Chem Eng, and the Rowlands Lab in Bioeng are working on a way to monitor these cells in situ, using optical imaging and fluorescent reporter cells.

The student will work on a system to image the fluorescence from a variety of locations within a large (liter-scale) volume using a large number of optical fibers coupled to a microscope. The student will use the system to monitor reactions in the reactor, and try to reconstruct the resulting fluorescence distribution. The student will need some basic precision manufacturing skills and an ability to prototype ideas quickly, but the most important is a willingness and ability to learn quickly."

More recently, we have also discovered that fungi can transport defense signals and nutrients via specialised hyphae. However, despite their importance, a major knowledge gap exists concerning the influence of the physio-chemical environment upon the function of these extensive mycelial networks, especially with regard to water transport processes and bacterial distribution. Moreover, there is little appreciation of how these dynamic processes occur within this black box at the cellular level, as it has not been possible to visualise these interactions nor assess microbiome behaviour in terms of its individual components.

We aim to develop microfluidic or ""Lab-on-a-Chip"" technologies to study the functional role of bacteria and fungi in soil. This technique has a great potential to provide a unique view of biological events at the level of single organisms and cells by enabling precise environmental control, high-resolution dynamic imaging, the simulation of environmental complexity and affording quantitative information. We recently developed the fungal-fungal interaction (FFI) device (Gimeo, Stanley et al., Commun. Biol., 2020, under review) to direct and constrain the growth of fungal cultures and therefore gain experimental access to FFIs at the hyphal level in real-time. We now aim to extend the functionality of this platform to understand the nature of fungus-driven bacterial dispersal at the single cell level. In this project, you will investigate the potential of bacteria to utilise hyphae as a fungal highway using advanced microscopy techniques. 

You will gain experience with microfluidic device manufacture, microscopy, microbiology, data analysis, designing experiments, statistical analysis, scientific writing and doing science

This enormous price puts the instrument out of reach of researchers in the developing world, and even several laboratories in developed countries as well. This project will seek to redress this balance, by developing a confocal microscope using modern low-cost rapid prototyping facilities, off-the-shelf microcontrollers and careful design, broadening access to this core technology throughout the world.

The student on this project will be responsible for building this instrument, based on a modern design known as a 'rescanned confocal'. This will require some work with a CAD package (like Solidworks), some 3D printing or CNC machining (possibly outsourced) and a bit of programming experience.

Unfortunately, there are a limited number of fluorophores that can be seen in the same image - separating them by their colour gets progressively harder because they all emit over a broad range of wavelengths which are difficult to separate. The same is not true for Raman spectra; these contain very sharp spectral features and can be easily identified from their spectral patterns, but the Raman effect is very weak - taking Raman maps of a surface is very laborious.

One solution to this problem is to use the Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) effect. SERS occurs when an analyte interacts with a gold nanoparticle, which enhances the electric field substantially. Since the Raman effect scales as the fourth power of the electric field, a modest 100x field enhancement results in 10^8 increase in the Raman effect, making it a bright and efficient molecular tag. This project will be to investigate the use of SERS particles as tags, from modelling the electromagnetic properties of these SERS particles, to using them to image tens of different features in a small cell.

This project is quite open-ended, and would therefore suit a range of students, from those interested in computational modelling to people interested in microscopy, instrument development, or even wet chemistry."

These analyses will be complemented by (1) local ancestry inference and (2) imaging data from the brain. The ancestry analysis will be performed with novel neural network-based local ancestry inference and will allow the GWAS and PRS to be tuned to the different, ancestry-specific LD structure found along the genome in admixed individuals. Both GWAS and PRS are generally confounded by ancestry variation within individuals, making these methods particularly challenging to apply in admixed populations. Indeed, current GWAS studies often discard such admixed individuals, focusing only on uniform, single-ancestry cohorts, and PRS scores are typically not applied to admixed individuals at all, although such individuals constitute some of the worlds largest populations (including most Latin Americans and most Afro-Caribbeans and African Americans). Such patients are often given reports indicating that the personalized PRS risk scores simply do not apply to them. The imaging component of this project will make use of multimodal datasets to extract information about the brains structure, and this information will be used as the phenotype for the GWAS and PRS applications. The specific aims of the project will be to adjust the local ancestry inference algorithm output to optimize the performance of GWAS and PRS on admixed individuals, and to investigate whether more flexible models can do better, particularly when combined with the higher dimensional imaging data. If the analysis of the imaging data proves to add too much additional complexity to the project in the time available simpler phenotypes (for instance pre-classified imaging data) will be used."

To date, there are some evidence that the aneurysm shape and the blood flow forces in it can determine whether an aneurysm will progress and rupture, but it remains difficult to predict which case will worsen and which will be stable. Making this prediction is important, because interventions to treat aneurysms are very invasive and carry risks, and they are expensive, and so we can't just offer them to everyone before we determine that they are most likely going to worsen. Our project aims to develop neural networks that can extract shape and fluid dynamics features of aneurysms from MR images, so that in future, we can use these features in another network to accurately predict outcomes and risks of disease progression. Doctors can then use our tools to make predictions quickly and inexpensively, without needing to have expertise in advanced biomechanics simulations typically needed to flow results. To date, there is no statistial shape model to desribe the aneurysm geometry, and no neural network that can produce flow results using shape features of the aneurysm. We will use a Graph Fourier Basis approach we recently developed to fit a 3D mesh to the aeurysm image, and to extract the shape latent features. We will further develop a neural network take shape features and output flow charactersitics (eg., wall shear stress and pressures), which will be supervised by mass CFD simultions.

ACL rupture, caused by excessive torsion or extension of the joint, is one of the most common forms of knee injury worldwide. ACL ruptures are most often treated surgically, with Anterior Cruciate Ligament Replacement Surgery (ACLRS): the surgeon removes the torn ACL from the inter-condylar notch of the knee, drills tunnels through the tibia and femur to the original ACL track, and passes a ligament graft through both. Once fixed in position, it replaces the ACL.
ACL Grafts are made up of ligaments harvested during the surgery, and as such they can exhibit a range of strengths and stiffnesses. The graft is generally folded and sewn together, creating anchorage features beyond the graft material, and when inserted through the tunnels in the femur and tibia it is fixed with one of four methods. Each of these methods has a different stiffness.  So the stiffness of the ACLRS construct, when finally in place, depends on the stiffness of the graft itself and the stiffness of the fixation in the femur and in the tibia.
The initial tension applied to the graft upon fixation has been shown to be of paramount importance for functional outcome of the knee.1√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú4  Graft and fixation method stiffness have both been shown to affect the load-displacement behaviour of the knee as well as final graft tension,7,8 which all influences the final biomechanics of the repaired knee. 
In a previous study, we have developed a graft stiffness measuring device, and proposed a clinical trial methodology to evaluate the impact of this new stiffness-based protocol on the outcome of the surgery.
The aim of this project is to develop a dynamic mathematical model of the knee to compute initial tension recommendations from graft stiffness and fixation method stiffness at all ranges of knee motion and function.

If we replace the three colours of the spectrum with thousands of wavelengths in a spectrum, we can learn much more about each pixel in an image. This is the promise of Raman microscopy.

Raman microscopy uses highly intense laser light to illuminate a sample. When the laser scatters from the sample, a very small fraction of it changes in wavelength, and this change is unique to a particular chemical bond. By mapping the sample using a spectrometer (which can image and quantify these wavelength changes) we can therefore gain chemical information about the sample, which is sufficient to diagnose a number of diseases, including (most notably) cancer.

The downside of Raman microscopy is that it is slow, and while it can be sped up by increasing the illumination intensity, eventually this comes at the cost of damaging the sample. The key to increasing imaging speed is therefore to share the laser out over more pixels, recording from them in parallel. The student on this project will develop a new system that can illuminate dozens of points simultaneously, thus significantly speeding up the imaging process. This will involve working on an existing Raman microscope, modifying it to implement this new scanning process.

Compared to MRI it is fast, easy to use and significantly less onerous on the patient. Nevertheless, there are limitations which we are working to overcome.

All current forms of ultrasound imaging require the user to place an ultrasound probe in contact with the skin. This in turn requires a skilled ultrasound technician to apply ultrasound gel and move the probe to image the organ of interest. A more elegant solution would be to use optical imaging to see the acoustic signal (as well as exciting it), thus removing the need for the technician, gel or even for the patient to lie on a bed. The acoustic signal could be simply recorded by imaging the patient's body with a very fast camera.

The Rowlands lab is working on developing optical ultrasound detectors based on evanescent wave sensors; these are extremely sensitive to minute changes in the position of an array of nanoparticles, and thus to a passing acoustic wave. The student working on this project will help develop this new type of ultrasound detector, building the nanoparticle suspension, excitation optics and imaging / readout. The ideal student would have a background in the physical sciences or engineering, with a willingness to try new things and learn.

More recently, we have also discovered that fungi can transport defense signals and nutrients via specialised hyphae. However, despite their importance, a major knowledge gap exists concerning the influence of the physio-chemical environment upon the function of these extensive mycelial networks, especially with regard to water transport processes and bacterial distribution. Moreover, there is little appreciation of how these dynamic processes occur within this black box at the cellular level, as it has not been possible to visualise these interactions nor assess microbiome behaviour in terms of its individual components.

We are developing microfluidic or ""Lab-on-a-Chip"" technologies to probe the interplay between soil-dwelling organisms and roots at the single cell level. This technique has a great potential to provide a unique view of biological events at the level of single organisms and cells by enabling precise environmental control, high-resolution dynamic imaging, the simulation of environmental complexity and affording quantitative information. In this project, you will use a microfluidic platform to direct and constrain the growth of fungal cultures, making it possible to study fungal-fungal interactions at the cellular level. Specifically, the so-called fungal-fungal interaction (FFI) device (Gimeo, Stanley et al., Nature Commun. Biol., 2020, under review) will be used to culture fungal hyphae and assess hyphal-hyphal interactions at the cellular level. The project will lay the foundation for future investigations concerning the dispersal of bacteria along fungal hyphae.

FH leads to very high low-density lipoprotein-associated cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and, untreated, cardiovascular disease at a young age. FH is diagnosed clinically according to LDL-C levels and family history, after which patients are offered genetic testing by targeted sequencing of five known FH genes: LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, LDLRAP, APOE. Unfortunately, only ~1:10 of people with FH know they have it, meaning there is a real need to improve FH diagnosis. 
LDL-C levels reported by hospital laboratories are actually only an estimation, and other blood parameters are unwittingly included in the ‚Äúapparent‚Äù LDL-C. When these parameters are present in high concentrations, people might be incorrectly categorised as having FH as their LDL-C level appears higher than it is in reality. On such blood parameter that has attracted attention recently is Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]. Lp(a) is an important biomarker in its own right for risk prediction in cardiovascular disease. However, Lp(a) carries cholesterol and appears as LDL-C when measured by hospital laboratories, meaning that people with high Lp(a) are more likely to be told they have FH even if they do not. In our specialist lipid clinic, we have found that 40% of people with high Lp(a) levels that were diagnosed with FH clinically would not have been classified as having FH if the impact of Lp(a) on their LDL-C had been taken into account. Lp(a) is not routinely measured except by lipid specialists, meaning that this effect can easily be missed in normal clinical practice.
 Here, we will here use UK Biobank whole-exome sequencing data to characterise the effect of including an LDL-C correction factor based on Lp(a) levels on diagnosis of FH. This will involve extraction and analysis of UKBB data . Known pathogenic mutations in FH genes will be used to identify ‚Äútrue‚Äù FH cases. We will determine optimum LDL-C thresholds with and without Lp(a)-related correction that could be used clinically to prioritise patients for FH genetic testing. The impact of ethnicity, LPA variants, and LDL-C-modulating genetic variants will be investigated, all of which are known to be important factors that influence Lp(a) and FH diagnosis.


Project hypothesis:
T2D and cancer share a number of heritable factors and may have common pathophysiology in their aetiology.
 
The project will aim to elucidate potential shared predisposition underlying the relationships between these diseases, through the following objectives:
1. To elucidate the extent of overlap and mechanistic relationships between DNA variants and contributing to T2D susceptibility and T2D-related traits including hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia, and three common malignancies - colorectal, prostate and postmenopausal breast cancer.
2. To determine whether T2D and related metabolic/metabolomic traits are causally related to colorectal, prostate and postmenopausal breast cancer using a Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach.

Methods:
The project will implement a comprehensive cross-disciplinary investigation of T2D and cancer that utilises the rich multi-omic resources of large international genetic consortia and the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, including 26,000 individuals with multi-omic data. Through public resources and EPIC data, the mechanistic relationships between DNA variants influencing the risk of T2D and colorectal, prostate and breast cancers, and affecting  cardiometabolic/metabolomic trait variability will be investigated. MR approaches will be implemented using polygenic risk scores to dissect the causal T2D and related metabolic/metabolomic traits-cancer relationships.

Outcomes:
This project will help identification of clinically-relevant novel omics-based cancer-T2D biomarkers through reduction in cancer mortality and will lead to improved approaches in precision medicine.

Overall, our recent work is unraveling the biological links between mechanical forces, mechanotransduction and endothelial cell responses. Understanding the distribution of the mechanical forces in the beating heart is essential to understanding how altered, pathological myocardial function and mechanotransduction can impact heart valve development and physiology. For this project, we will combine live imaging with mathematical modeling to provide a quantitative map of cardiac force distribution and offer insight into how forces affect valve development using zebrafish as a model organism. Predicting endocardial forces associated with the heartbeat and linking the effect of forces with specific valve defects in models of cardiomyopathies. Tissue mechanics lead to mechanical stimuli at the cellular level. EdCs are exposed to two main types of forces: flow-induced shear stress and cell-cell tension. Hindering the progress of research in this field is the lack of robust methods to quantify mechanical forces in such a dynamic and complex 3D architecture as that of the heart. To bypass these difficulties, we developed an approach combining in vivo imaging and numerical methods in two steps: (1) live imaging to resolve tissue deformation (strain) in 3D and extract blood flow velocity profiles in 2D, (2) Mathematical modelling of blood flow to mechanical forces in 3D and to cross-validate the in vivo measurements. We will characterize endocardial deformation by imaging the fluorescently labelled endocardium at high temporal resolution.

Importantly, the hypothesis that increased brain entropy rate corresponds to states of enriched experience has been robustly supported by neuroimaging research. In effect, recent research has shown that altered states such as psychedelics [3], [4], meditation [5], and states of flow associated with musical improvisation reliably exhibit higher brain entropy rate. Conversely, states such as deep sleep, general anaesthesia, and loss of consciousness have consistently shown reduced brain entropy rate [6], [7].
Estimating brain entropy rate accurately is important to psychedelic research, as the therapeutic mechanisms of psychedelics are thought to depend on their acute entropy enhancing effect - potentially reflecting a window of opportunity (and plasticity) mediating therapeutic change [8], [9]. Todays more popular method to estimate brain entropy rate is via the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) algorithm [2]. However, this algorithm has a number of shortcomings: (1) its results are not comparable between subjects, (2) it requires long window lengths in order to provide accurate estimations, and (3) it doesnt have principled ways to decompose the effects of different frequency bands. Alternative algorithms to estimate the entropy rate exist, including Context Tree Weighting and autoregressive methods. However, no systematic study has been made over neuroimaging data from experiments with psychedelic drugs to compare their performance.
The students objective is to benchmark quantitatively existing estimators of entropy rate in the context of neuroscience and their application in EEG, MEG, and fMRI signals. The main goal will be to identify which algorithm enables a better classification between condition across various datasets, and which algorithm enables better predictions of the corresponding subjective reports associated with these datasets. Additionally, there will be space for the student to use insights from existent estimators to design new tools to estimate brain entropy rate.

Each device has more than 2500 sensing pixels in an array (2 x2 mm total area). The surface of each pixel is effectively the gate of an FET transistor, so responds to the surface change. As manufactured such devices  are inherently selective to pH. However, if we coat with an ion selective polymer membrane we can make the pixels sensitive to the concentrations of different ions in in solution - making an Ion Selective Electrode (ISE).  Hence across an array we can detect the main ions present in physiological fluids or tissue extracellular fluids  - this is particularly useful when studying injury processes in the human brain or human kidney.

Our group recently developed EczemaNet, a prototype novel computer vision pipeline for automated evaluation of eczema severity from camera images (Pan, Hurault et al. 2020). EczemaNet uses a CNN that first detects areas of AD from camera images and then makes probabilistic predictions of the severity of seven clinical signs of AD. EczemaNet was trained using the camera images with eczema severity scores provided by trained clinical staff. However, the severity scores may have inter-rater variability, resulting in noisy labels. 

This project aims to further improve EczemaNet by achieving a better generalisation capability in the presence of noisy labels.

This can be especially true in premature babies (neonates), whose development time and environment have been compromised.
In cases of  Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS), the left ventricle and aorta are undersized and under-developed, and surgical reconstruction is often undertaken to provide the patient with a ventricle of adequate size to deliver the pumping required, and a larger aorta is constructed.  
However, imaging these vulnerable babies (especially tiny neonates) is not without risk and therefore images and models of the aortic anatomy (normal and pathological) are not available. Surgical reconstruction must thus be based on estimates rather than known geometries.

Approximately 400 million adults have a diabetes diagnosis, and around 15 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed worldwide each year. Accumulating observational and experimental evidence suggests that these two diseases are linked, and epidemiological data support an association between T2D and elevated risk of cancer at several anatomical sites. However, major questions regarding the pathophysiology underlying these relationships remain unanswered. There are many predisposing DNA variants shared between T2D and different cancers suggesting common aetiologic pathways. Moreover, our preliminary data indicates that some cancer genetic loci are associated with metabolic abnormalities that predispose to T2D, including hyperinsulinaemia and dyslipidaemia.

Project hypothesis:
T2D and cancer share a number of heritable factors and may have common pathophysiology in their aetiology.
 
The project will aim to elucidate potential shared predisposition underlying the relationships between these diseases, through the following objectives:
1. To elucidate the extent of overlap and mechanistic relationships between DNA variants and contributing to T2D susceptibility and T2D-related traits including hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia, and three common malignancies - colorectal, prostate and postmenopausal breast cancer.
2. To determine whether T2D and related metabolic/metabolomic traits are causally related to colorectal, prostate and postmenopausal breast cancer using a Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach.

Methods:
The project will implement a comprehensive cross-disciplinary investigation of T2D and cancer that utilises the rich multi-omic resources of large international genetic consortia and the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, including 26,000 individuals with multi-omic data. Through public resources and EPIC data, the mechanistic relationships between DNA variants influencing the risk of T2D and colorectal, prostate and breast cancers, and affecting  cardiometabolic/metabolomic trait variability will be investigated. MR approaches will be implemented using polygenic risk scores to dissect the causal T2D and related metabolic/metabolomic traits-cancer relationships.

Outcomes:
This project will help identification of clinically-relevant novel omics-based cancer-T2D biomarkers through reduction in cancer mortality and will lead to improved approaches in precision medicine."

It is characterised by an abnormally rapid and irregular electrical activation of the upper chambers of the heart, the atria, and is independently associated with large increases in mortality and severe morbidity.

Treatments for AF remain suboptimal, as they tend to be standardised and not make full use of the available patient-specific information. In particular, electrical signals (electrocardiograms, EGMs) recorded from the atrial wall (with limited spatial coverage and resolution) can be used to characterise the electrophysiological (EP) properties of the underlying atrial tissue and guide treatment. Nevertheless, there are currently no techniques that can reliable do this in the clinic.

Physics-inspired neural networks - PINNs (1) have recently been proposed as a reliable method to simultaneous solve differential equations that describe the physics of a system and estimate relevant properties of the medium, given sparse experimental data.

Aims

The main aim of this project is to use PINNs to characterise the electrical properties of the atrium relevant for atrial fibrillation (AF) from clinical electrocardiogram (EGM) signals, namely conduction velocity and electrical excitability. The created PINN will be trained using synthetic data from electrophysiology simulations and will be tested on both synthetic EGMs and clinical EGMs acquired in patients.

Task 1 √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú Synthetic Data Creation

Using an existing simulator of atrial EGMs (2), the student will synthesise artificial EGMs in a variety of circumstances: with a variety of CVs and excitabilities; for different type of electrical activation and different positioning and number of the catheters acquiring the EGMs.

Task 2 √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú Network Training and Testing

Using the data created in task 1, we will train a PINN to estimate CV and excitability from synthetic EGMs. The created PINN will then be tested on patient EGMs and its findings will be correlated to clinical information from the same patients. 

It is expected that the findings of this project will form the basis of a first-author scientific abstract to an international conference and be part of future scientific articles from our research group.

The student will gain a practical understanding of neural networks, particularly PINNs. They will become familiar with computational methods used to model biological processes and improve their programming skills. This project will also allow the student to gain experience in using a high-performance computer and will allow them to improve their data analysis skills.

Additionally, the student will integrate a vibrant multidisciplinary team, with ample opportunities to improve their research skills, from literature review to scientific presentation.

However, mass screening programmes only detect 50% of congenital heart malformations. Being surprised at birth with cardiac malformation result in less time for clinicians to plan for and provide treatment, resulting in higher mortality risks, and in greater risks for neurological maldevelopment, due to prolonged duration where the malformation is not treated and continue to compromise brain oxygen transport. 

Foundation models in image processing has made waves. Trained with a large dataset, they can be used to improve performance of any specific image processing task (segmentation, motion tracking, disease detection, etc) while requiring a much less sample size in these tasks. In our lab, we have a collection of large dataset of fetal heart echo images in 4D. Here, we will develop the first foundation model for fetal echo images, adapting architecture known to have good performance in 2D camera and medical images (DINO, SAM, and SIMCLR) models. We will subsequently use the foundation model to train a network for segmentation, and show that the foundation model improves the performance of this subsequent task, and require a much smaller dataset for it. 

The student will work with a research team, and stand to gain AI image processing techniques, as well as real-world applications of such techniques. They can also interact with fetal cardiologists collaborators in Europe for a well-rounded exposure. "

However, unlike most other NTDs, the incidence of CL is increasing with an estimated 1 million cases every year. The diagnosis of CL can be difficult, as it can cause lesions of similar appearance to other skin diseases such as leprosy, bacterial and fungal infections and eczema. Therefore, cases have to be confirmed by identifying parasites in skin scrapings using microscopy. This technique involves the use of a scalpel blade to remove tissue from the lesion. This is an invasive and painful procedure that requires skilled health workers. Herein we will design, develop and test a novel non-invasive microneedle patch for diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis, at the point-of-care. The test will be significantly less invasive, less painful and faster than the current scalpel-based technology. It will be based on the colorimetric detection of parasite-specific mRNA biomarkers present in high concentration in skin interstitial fluid, especially when sampled near the skin lesion. The detection will rely on the sequence-specific capturing of mRNA from parasites using bespoke hydrogels chemically functionalized with peptide nucleic Acid (PNA) hybridization probes and qualitative colorimetric detection (yes/no) using intercalator dyes embedded with the gel itself. The project will involve the design, synthesis and characterization of the hydrogel-coated patches and their technical validation in vitro using extracted RNA from cultured parasites."

The device uses pH-sensitive pixels, known as ISFETs, to detect a change in pH produced as DNA molecules are replicated through amplification reactions. 
Currently, the group uses an amplification reaction, known as LAMP, that can be conducted at one, constant temperature, as opposed to the more common PCR, which cycles through three different temperatures. PCR requires fewer reagents and is easier to design compared to LAMP, attributes well-suited for low-cost applications. However, the thermal cycling required increases hardware and power demands and gives slower results.
The main hurdle in PCR is denaturing the DNA, which typically requires high temperatures. However, a study released in 2018 used simulations to suggest that AC electric fields could lead to DNA denaturation at lower temperatures, thus opening a path towards isothermal PCR.
In this project, the student will first attempt to experimentally verify the results from the paper by designing microwave resonators through FEM simulation and observing DNA denaturation using fluorescence microscopy. This will then progress to conducting PCR on the fabricated microwave platform. A stretch objective would be to then integrate the microchips used by CBIT with the microwave resonator to form a diagnostic device. 
There is a large scope for creativity within this project and the student will be able to lead their project independently. The project will give the student an experience of high-impact research and an opportunity to learn a wide range of valuable, inter-disciplinary skills in microwave engineering, molecular biology, and bioengineering. A successful outcome will allow the student to report the project results as part of a conference publication.
Skills:

-	Ansys HFSS is a finite-element software that will be used to simulate microwave resonators, but previous experience is not necessary
-	Basic PCB design

To develop novel AI powered data driven and MR physics guided super-resolution and blind denoising methods for cutting-edge cardiovascular MR techniques, potentially producing step-changes in routine clinical CMR. The AI models will be validated on prospectively scanned low-resolution data with degraded image quality.

Background:
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) the major cause of mortality globally with an estimated 17.9 million people died from CVD in 2019, representing 32% of all global deaths. Cardiovascular MRI diagnosis enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) has a promising future. However, the limited spatial resolution and inherent noise in MR data could affect the AI assisted diagnosis and analysis.
 
Main goal:
Cardiovascular MR (CMR) is one of the major clinical tools for diagnosis, prognosis, risk stratification, treatment planning and follow-up. 3D late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) CMR plays an important role in scar tissue detection in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, LGE CMR technique suffers from limited spatial resolution and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Increasing the acquired spatial resolution of LGE CMR is a major challenge and generally not recommended in practice, because it is expensive and time-consuming. Thus, super-resolution (SR) based post-processing becomes a promising option to increase the spatial resolution without increasing LGE CMR data time. In this study, we will design novel data and MR physics driven deep learning methods to boost the spatial resolution of the LGE CMR images while blindly suppressing image noise by utilising recently proposed Noise2Noise models. Retrospectively acquired data will firstly be used to train a general super-resolution model and prospectively acquired data will then be incorporated to fine tune the developed model for the super-resolution of really acquired low-resolution data with lower SNR.
 
Experimental approach:
Establish AI based strategies to i) super-resolve and denoise retrospectively acquired data, ii) perform trained model(s) on prospectively acquired data, iii) transfer learning using information from prospective data, and iv) validation against clinical quantifications (e.g., atrial scar).
 
Outcome:
Developing data driven and MR physics driven super-resolution and blind denoising method(s) for LGE CMR and comparing and quantifying clinical estimations using the developed AI powered method, e.g., estimation of atrial scar percentages before and after using our super-resolution methods."

Almost all biological processes that subtend cellular functions and life require robust operation in the face of perturbations and uncertainties in the intracellular milieu and cellular growth environment. Such robustness is achieved at the molecular level via sets of specific biochemical reactions that implement biomolecular controllers using the molecules of life.

In this context, recent work at the intersection of synthetic biology and control has demonstrated the advantages of taking a rigorous modelling approach to deeply understand dynamic robustness and to enable the analysis and design of biomolecular controllers.

The goal of this project will be to model, simulate and computationally analyse core biomolecular control systems, such as incoherent feedforward loop or proportional-integral-derivative (PID) feedback controllers so as to computationally characterise their dynamic behaviours in the presence of perturbations and or modelling uncertainties.

As part of this project and if interested, the student could also explore recent research results focused on biomolecular mechanisms enabling signal differentiation (time derivative computation) in living cells. In particular, the project will computationally assess proposed strategies to preserve performance of molecular differentiator motifs even in the presence of high-frequency input signal components, which are detrimental to the performance of most differentiators. For this, the work will be based on recent core molecular motifs for signal differentiation proposed in the literature (see reference 1). Such motifs are crucial to the realisation of derivative control actions in synthetic biology.

This project is computer-based and will involve writing computer programs in Python or Julia. The modelling framework will make use of ODE numerical solvers and potentially of the Tellurium Python package (or similar Julia packages) for reaction-based modelling. The project will be suitable for a highly motivated student interested in control theory and synthetic biology.

Implementation of biomolecular controllers is at the core of synthetic biology and allows synthetic biologists to improve the reliability and performance of biosystems. However, such biomolecular feedback controllers typically impose cellular burden by sequestering resources from native cellular processes. This project aims to develop feedback controllers that use minimal resources to achieve their robust performance objectives.

This project will largely focus on developing feedback controllers that improve the performance and robustness of biosystems while requiring minimal cellular resources. The project will start by carrying out a comparative study of different biomolecular control mechanisms (control via regulation of gene copy number, transcription, mRNA half-life, translation, protein half-life, and post-translation modifications) in the context of resource consumption. In a second stage, the project will investigate the possible trade-offs between resource consumption and performance of biomolecular controllers.

The project will be of computational nature, and thus requires coding skills in MATLAB (or Python, or Julia) and modelling understanding of biomolecular systems. The project is suitable for a highly motivated student interested in synthetic biology, systems biology, and control engineering.

The eczema severity is currently assessed by trained clinical staff. However, the subjective nature of assessing these disease signs could be a source of significant inter and intra-observer variability. Our group recently developed EczemaNet, a prototype novel computer vision pipeline using CNN for automated evaluation of eczema severity from camera images (Pan, Hurault et al. 2020). EczemaNet was trained using the camera images that are predominantly from white skin with the under-representation of darker skin tones.

This project aims to develop an AI tool to automatically detect the skin colour on each image and synthesise equivalent skin images of other tones of interest by image-to-image translation. Once the model learns the unique characteristics of an image collection (e.g. eczema on black skin) and figuring out how these characteristics could be translated into the other image collection (e.g. eczema on white skin), the model could synthesise an image of white skin from that of black skin and vice versa. 
The student is expected to review, implement, and validate the image-to-image analysis pipeline using off-the-shelf deep-learning and image analysis software packages for automated image-to-image translation of skin images.

Regardless of the species, escaping to shelter when under threat is a fundamental behaviour for survival. This requires that animals learn shelter locations, which can be challenging as exploring an environment potentially exposes them to predators. They must therefore be able to learn rapidly, from a limited amount of experience. Animals have demonstrated their ability to do this, but most current AI models require millions of exploration timesteps to achieve satisfactory performances in similar tasks.

Precision oncology aims at prescribing the most suitable anti-cancer treatment to a patient to ensure maximum efficacy and minimum side effect. By analysing pharmaco-omics data, we can identify individual variability in drug response by studying the molecular profiles of the patient's tumours. Furthermore, clinical features such as age, co-morbidities and the like can influence how patients respond to treatment. Artificial Intelligence (AI), and more concretely its most developed subarea Machine Learning (ML), holds tremendous promise for precision oncology. Recently published ML studies show that, at least in some cases, it is possible to predict which patients are resistant, or responsive, to treatment from their molecular and/or clinical features. However, a major challenge is the very large number of features describing each patient.

About the supervisor:
Dr Pedro Ballester has a 10-year track record on this research topic. His later paper on this topic was on the application of AI to patient response prediction to drug treatments from multi-omics tumour profiles (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202201501). His group has hence developed infrastructure around the data sources I will employ. For example, the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) from the US National Cancer Institute (NCI).

Research plan:
The first stage will be to master scripts to integrate clinical and omics data from the GDC. Here we already combined the clinical responses annotated with the RECIST standard as two types, namely ‚ÄúResponder‚Äù (including ‚ÄúComplete Response‚Äù and ‚ÄúPartial Response‚Äù) and ‚ÄúNon-Responder‚Äù (including ‚ÄúStable Disease‚Äù and ‚ÄúClinical Progressive Disease‚Äù).   
Then we will select problem instances with various dimensionalities as case studies. That is, cohorts of patients with the same cancer type, whose tumours were profiled with the same omics technology and administered the same drug. Tumours were comprehensively profiled (CNA, DNA methylation, miRNA and mRNA)
Lastly, we will investigate the application of ML techniques to identify the most predictive features among the hundreds to thousands of them. Among the techniques to be assessed, we will look at integrating ML algorithms with feature selection schemes such as OMC, Boruta or RFE. Particular attention will be paid to rigorously estimate classification performance, some methods for this are already implemented here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MXM/

While our group has been studying brain histamine and serotonin in mice, human measurements are much more limited. Unfortunately, the human brain is inaccessible for investigative purposes. However, studies have shown that inflammation is a whole-body response and brain-body inflammation axes exist. An intricate connection between the skin and the brain underlies a bidirectional inflammatory nexus. Stress has been demonstrated to trigger physiological changes in the skin and the dermal cells contain high levels of both histamine and serotonin. Therefore, we ask can skin be an inflammatory model of the brain?

In order to establish this interconnectivity between inflammation in the skin and in the brain, we seek to develop translational chemical tools to measure histamine in the skin. To do so, it is important to validate that the chemical sensors can indeed detect changes in histamine levels in the reticular dermis of human skin, which is where histamine is synthesize and released by mast cells under inflammation. In this project, we want to explore the different mechanisms that can target the histaminergic system of the skin to induce an evoked histamine release upon stimulus. This would include a literature review on reagents that can target the histaminergic system of the skin and can be applied without causing additional inflammatory responses. The project would also involve studying the diffusion dynamics of the reagent to investigate whether it can be delivered locally to the site of interest.

The ideal candidate would have interest in investigating the brain-body nexus through the development of anti-inflammatory skin reagents. The student will learn about different electrochemical techniques, including fast scan cyclic voltammetry and fast scan-controlled adsorption voltammetry, used to detect ambient and evoked neurotransmitter levels in response to the developed histamine-targeting reagent."

Whilst polarization cues for communication and host detection are also thought to be processed as structured spatiotemporal signals, the mechanisms by which polarization information is integrated with object detection and motion vision pathways in these contexts is less well understood.

This project aims to measure neuronal responses of motion sensitive interneurons to moving patterns of polarised light in flies and butterflies. The project will involve mounting and dissecting insects for extracellular electrophysiology, collecting wild flies and butterflies in the summer, and data analysis in Matlab. Programming experience is useful but can be learned as part of the project.

Recent neurophysiological evidence suggests that flies anticipate the sensory consequences of their actions (a so-called forward model) to prevent stabilization reflexes from occurring in response to volitional movements.
 
In theory, this forward model must adapt to account for variable neuronal delays and changes in the sensory environment. This project will test this hypothesis by measuring the electrophysiological responses of motion sensitive interneurons in the fly brain whilst the fly is walking within a closed-loop virtual reality platform with control over the latency of sensory feedback.

This project will involve dissecting flies to access the brain whilst they walk on a spherical treadmill; extracellular electrophysiology of motion sensitive neurons during walking; data analysis in Matlab or Python. Programming experience is useful but can be learned as part of the project.

This is thought to underly a form of navigation or spatial orientation, termed polarotaxis. Previous results in the lab suggest that flies are more likely to orient to a polarised light pattern when they are free to rotate, rather than when tethered in place on a wing beat analyser that enables the measurement of the animal‚Äôs intended turns. This difference may arise due to the absence of visual feedback when tethered in place and can be tested by closing the loop such that the animal‚Äôs movement is fed back to update the polariser position.

The aim of this project is to compare polarotaxis in tethered flying insects, including flies and butterflies, both under open- and closed-loop conditions. Methods will include image analysis for pose estimation (including neural network training in Python using DeepLabCut), programming stepper motors using Arduino, and data analysis in Matlab or Python. Familiarity with programming is helpful but could be learned at the start of the project.

There exist data from experiments with cadavers and with volunteers on injury to the spinal column in various loading modes. The data are not enough to develop a robust injury-risk curve.

Virtual screening (VS) has become an important source of small-molecule drug leads. A benchmark is needed to identify the VS method/s that will perform best prospectively for that therapeutic target. Benchmarks are also needed to find the optimal settings for the selected VS method/model. A VS benchmark is a library with two classes of molecules: those whose activity for the target is above a given threshold - actives as the positive class- and those with weaker or no activity at all - inactives as the negative class. Among them, a screened library is one whose molecules have been screened in the same centre and using same assay/s, e.g. the results of high-throughput screening (HTS) a compound library against the considered target.
Unfortunately, HTS data have been used for VS benchmarking in a convenient yet unrealistic manner (e.g. generating benchmarks with much smaller chemical diversity than HTS). The question is how useful are these HTS-derived datasets as VS benchmarks with respect to the ground truth represented by the unadulterated HTS datasets.

A VS benchmark is a library with two classes of molecules: those whose activity for the target is above a given threshold - actives as the positive class- and those with weaker or no activity at all - inactives as the negative class. Among them, a screened library is one whose molecules have been screened in the same centre and using same assay/s, e.g. the results of high-throughput screening (HTS) a compound library against the considered target.
In the absence of publicly-available HTS data, one has to resort to define a simulated-library (SimL) benchmark. Here one gathers actives from the literature and generates decoys from each of them so that these molecules collectively simulate a screened HTS library. This is the most common type of VS benchmark, where decoys are often required to have dissimilar chemical structures to that of their active to make them even less likely to be also active (activity is a rare event and hence randomly-chosen molecules are already unlikely to be active). Furthermore, an active and their property-matched decoys have similar physico-chemical properties so that they cannot be trivially discriminated by one of these properties, as this does not happen prospectively either. One popular example of such benchmarks is DUD-E (http://dude.docking.org/).
The question is how useful are these SimL benchmarks for VS with respect to the ground truth represented by the entire HTS datasets (in the targets for which these are available). We expect this study to reveal which are active-to-inactive ratios and decoy schemes best anticipate performance on HTS datasets. This will be useful to decide best SimL benchmarking in absence of HTS data.

Microvascular flow is closely related to tissue function and pathology including cancer and cardiovascular disease. For example, as tumors grow, they eventually outgrow their blood supply and angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is induced. The resulting vasculature can be different from those in healthy tissue. Therefore, the microvasculature can offer valuable information for detection and diagnosis of pathology.
Imaging techniques to gather information on the microvasculature and to characterize a lesion as benign or malignant includes dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, contrast enhanced CT, and ultrasound. However, they lack the sensitivity and resolution for imaging microcirculation. Recet advance in super-resolution ultrasound offers very high resolution imaging (tens of microns) of microvasculature in human, which is also a more affordable bed side technology. 

Aims/Objectives:
‚Ä¢	To develop image analysis algorithms and an analysis software to quantify a range of features in acquired the microvascular images. Example tasks include segmentation of vessels from the image, and calculating features of these vascular geometry including e.g. size, torturosity will be calculated.

This is achieved by simply detecting electrophysiological activity from muscles at the skin surface. These recordings are then effectively ‚Äòreverse engineered‚Äô to identify single motor unit discharge patterns, which encode movement information [1][2][3].  One could use this information to control external devices via a non-invasive neuro-muscular interface, to achieve brain-computer interaction or human augmentation. Recently, sEMG for neural interfacing has gained attention from industry, beyond its conventional clinical and research use, whereby neural activity is mapped into real-time myo-control paradigms for augmented experiences with gaming and consumer electronics [4][5].
To explore the complete interfacing process from recording to signal processing to encoding, this multi-faceted project will entail designing and implementing a neuromuscular interface for motion/force control of a simple game such flappy bird, ping-pong, snake etc. There are two branches to the project implementation:
1.	Interface design combined with sEMG signal recording and processing, targeting self-selected forearm muscles.
2.	Algorithm design for the mapping of neural activity into a myo-control paradigm, and a system to transfer information to the chosen/designed gaming platform.
We plan to make use of your resultant set-up for future control experiments in the lab, as well as give you the opportunity to partake in future outreach activities, teaching the public about the exciting and diverse applications of sEMG.

In this project, you will study these questions with a combination of mechanical theory and meta-analysis. The literature is full of data on maximum jump speed for animals of different sizes, but this data is scattered far and wide.

The variation of posture with size.","2025-05-21 12:19:01","Animals move by using muscle, the ancient biological motor. Muscle contraction results in the production of a force, which is transmitted to the ground via the skeletal system. A classic problem in biomechanics is how larger animals deal with the increasing dominance of gravity - the gravitational force depends on the volume of the animal, but the available force generated by muscle is proportional to the area. Because larger animals have smaller surface-to-volume ratios, they are relatively weaker. 

One theory has been that animals can solve this problem by changing posture as they increase in size. And indeed, a mouse is crouched, and an elephant is roughly upright. This change in posture is thought to result in an increase in the Ground Reaction Force, and this increase may help animals to overcome the problem posed by the differential scaling of gravitational and muscle force.

In this project, you will explore this idea by collecting a large dataset on ground reaction force measurements from the literature - plenty of data is available, but scattered. You will then analyse this data with theoretical models on the scaling and mechanical limitations of musculoskeletal systems, to examine if the variation of Ground Reaction Forces observed is consistent with theoretical arguments."

In the UK, most patients have to wait 6 weeks to get an echo scan. Someone rushed to the emergency room may actually have to wait many hours to get one. This is obviously dangerous. The reason is that to perform echocardiography scan, a sonographer need years of training, and even then, if they are inexperienced, they have cause large measurement errors and unusable data. Insufficient supply of these sonographers caused this long wait time. In low-resource countries, this is even worst, as skilled sonographers are even fewer. 

We have developed AI algorithms that reduces the skill needed to perform echo scans. Instead of requiring the sonographer position the transducer very accurately at specific positions, we let them do scans at various random positions while recording the position of the transducer via a position sensor. Subsequently, we reconstruct the 3D shape of the heart from very few 2D echo scans using our novel shape modelling algorithm. The recontructed 3D shape over the heartbeat can then automatically give us measurements of the cardiac size, dimensions, volumes, volume changes, and myocardial contractions, stuff that doctors usually need to evaluate the heart. By not requiring skilful positioning of the transducer, we remove the requirement that the sonographer needs to be highly skilled, and by automating the measurement process, we become more precise and the the sonographer does not need to know a lot about cardiology to make quantifications from images. The result, we believe is that anyone can now perform echocardiography, and this will greatly enhance the availability of echocardiography for patients. Further, we plan to implement this in the new form of echo machines, pocket-sized, handheld echo machines. This will make it very cheap to easy to perform echo, and should be highly beneficial in low-resource countries all over the world. 

In this project, we will help the data collection of the echo images to validate the accuracy of our device, working with a PhD student and a team of cardiologists and songraphers at Imperial NHS (Dr. Amit Kaura and Prof. Jamil Mayet and their team). We will also interface with collaborators in Sub-Saharan African countries, who are interested to adopt the system. These efforts will help with our plans to commercialize the system.  "

This allows them to be trained which smaller amounts of data than conventional neural networks, ensuring that the achieved solutions obey the known physics of a system (Karniadakis et al., 2021).
We have successfully used PINNs to solve problems in cardiac electromagnetism in the past (Herrero Martin et al., 2022) and would now like to extend this formalism to predictions blood glucose levels in type I diabetes patients. These predictions are based on continuous glucose measurements from the same patient and can be used to improve the automation and effect of insulin delivery in these patients. We expect that in the long term this will lead to an improvement in the quality of life of patients with type I diabetes (Ramli et al., 2019). 

Aims
1)	To simulate realistic blood glucose traces using a detailed simulator of glucose metabolism to create blood glucose temporal traces from 10 patients with different metabolic profiles (Dalla Man et al., 2014; Magdelaine et al., 2015).  
2)	To implement a PINNs approach to predict future blood glucose from synthetic datasets and quantitative assess its accuracy in comparison to state-of-the-art predictions (Li et al., 2020).

Imprecise timing or duration of acquisition window can result in cardiac images corrupted with blurring or ghosting artefacts due to allowing too much intra-frame motion. A framework is needed where the acquisition window can be optimally adjusted irrespective of patient type or heart rate. In this project, machine learning methods will be applied to breath-hold cardiac CINE imaging to generate low dimensional manifolds representing cardiac motion. The low dimensional manifolds will be processed automatically to detect the most quiescent period within the cardiac cycle. "

Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) map the activity of hundreds of cortical neurons into signals to move a computer cursor or a robot, or even to reanimate the subject‚Äôs paralysed limbs using electrical stimulation of muscles or nerves [1,2]. Yet, despite these tremendous feats, there remain many open questions regarding the best design for BCIs.
 
One crucial open question is where to implant the recording electrodes. Most BCIs are based on recordings from motor cortex, since this region is the main brain ‚Äúoutput‚Äù to the spinal circuits that drive movement [3]. However, motor cortex may not be ideal because it ‚Äúfilters out‚Äù many higher-order features of behaviour, such as which part of a sequence you are executing [3,4]. An alternative approach is to record neural activity from parietal cortex, a ‚Äúhigher‚Äù cortical area that is more involved in associative and visuomotor processing.
 
In this project you will compare motor cortical and parietal BCIs by analysing publicly available data from two human participants implanted with intracortical electrodes in these regions [5,6]. Primarily, you will investigate: (1) whether people solve the same task using similar mental strategies based on each of these recordings, and (2) whether the stability of neural population dynamics [7] and BCI control shows different degrees of stability in each of these regions. Answering these questions will inform whether one of these two regions is better for generalisation across individuals and to achieving robust control, thus helping to address two of the main questions in the field.

Animals including humans can rapidly adjust their behaviour in the presence of perturbations. These span counteracting mechanical perturbations to the limb [1] (such as when running into water), or distorted feedback about the state of the limb [2] (such as when reaching into a pond). Yet, despite considerable effort, the neural basis for this rapid learning or motor adaptation remains largely elusive.
 
Recent theoretical and computational advances in understanding the coordinated activity of neural populations [3] are helping to cast light into this fascinating problem. For example, our group has shown that, in contrast to learning a new skill through substantial practice, this form of learning may not need ‚Äúplastic changes‚Äù in the brain [4,5]. Moreover, while motor regions of the brain seem to be key for counteracting mechanical perturbations [4,6], learning to adapt to distorted feedback may be driven by higher brain regions [6]. In this project, you will systematically compare these two forms of adaptation by multi-area neural population recordings from monkeys performing these two classic experiments on different days (data from [3]). These analyses will include understanding changes in neural dynamics as animals plan and execute these movements, as well as a comparison between motor regions of the brain. Your results will shed light in the neural basis for rapid learning and also inform the field of brain-computer interfaces, which necessitates more flexible ‚Äúdecoding algorithms‚Äù.

Most research that aims to understand the mechanisms of invasive fungal infections uses murine infection models, where the level (the severity) of infection and the effect of anti-fungal therapeutics is usually quantified by fungal burden. However, quantifying the viable fungal burden in murine infection models during disease progression remains a difficult task. 

Currently, qPCR methods are widely used to estimate total fungal burden. However, qPCR cannot distinguish live and dead fungi and therefore the qPCR level does not reflect the viable fungal burden. CFU count of viable fungi has also been used but is less accurate compared to qPCR due to manual counting. As a result, the fungal biology community currently uses a mix of qPCR and CFU count to quantify fungal burden, resulting in contrasting quantifications of fungal burden.

This project aims to develop a model that can infer latent (unobserved) in vivo viable fungal burden count using the observed qPCR fungal burden and inaccurate viability data (in CFUs). The student is expected to propose several mathematical models of Aspergillus fumigatus growth in vivo and compare them using state-of-the-art model selection tools. Model development and comparison will use different in vivo Aspergillus growth data obtained by our collaborators.  "

The key to treating glaucoma is to lower pressure in the eye, but we do not fully understand the pressure-regulating machinery. The relevant tissue is the trabecular meshwork and Schlemms canal (TM/SC), located around the periphery of the iris. Aqueous humour (fluid that fills the eye) continually drains through the TM/SC and the resistance to flow through these tissues is what determines eye pressure. Our laboratory aims to understand the mechanics of fluid flow through the TM/SC, so as to understand how it generates hydraulic resistance to control eye pressure. Our past research has shown that this mechanism is closely linked to cellular biomechanics.

This project will develop a perfusion system which will allow us (for the first time) to directly visualise fluid flow through the TM/SC and the biomechanical response of SC and TM cells. There at least two separate approaches for this project . One aspect will focus on using mouse eyes, which our laboratory has shown mimics important aspects of the human TM/SC. Transgenic mice are available that encode fluorescent protein within SC, allowing in principle microscopic visualisation of SC during flow. The aim would be to develop a perfusion system to mount the mouse eye onto a microscope stage to allow SC to be visualised during flow, with fluorescent tracer nanoparticles used to assess flow patterns. The second aspect of the project will use strips of TM/SC tissue isolated from human eyes (provided by a collaborator in the US). The goal is to develop a microfluidics platform to mount and perfuse these tissue strips (~ 1 mm x 0.1 mm) on a microscope stage to directly visualise SC and TM behaviour under flow. We have a preliminary design for both aspects of the project to help students get started. Both aspects of the work will feature centre stage in future glaucoma research, meaning that the projects will have full access to laboratory personnel and support and an opportunity to publish the work in peer reviewed journals."

A tremendous portion of this investment is generally spent on pre-clinical and clinical testing of new drugs prior to their marketing stage. Various existing and emerging systems have been employed for pre-clinical testing prior to clinical trials involving patients. Pre-clinical testing of therapeutics can mainly be categorized into two groups, in vitro testing (i.e. traditional cell- and tissue-cultures) and in vivo testing (i.e. animal models). In vitro tests cannot recapitulate the complex environment of the body. On the other hand, in vivo tests are expensive, time-consuming, ethically controversial, and poor predictors of human responses because of physiological differences between humans and animals. Recently, organ-on-a-chip (OOC) systems have achieved wide attention as a suitable alternative for traditional pre-clinical tests. Organ-on-a-chip systems are multi-channel cell culture systems engineered to mimic the physiological environment and function of an organ on a small chip. Here is the link for a very interesting TED talk about organ-on-a-chip systems: 
https://www.ted.com/talks/geraldine_hamilton_body_parts_on_a_chip#t-659395
Among OOC systems, vessel-on-a-chip is one of the most important systems for drug screening studies because blood vessels are the first and the main organ of contact with pharmaceutical compounds after their injection into the body. Furthermore, vasculature-related diseases are one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide.
The goal of this project is design and development of vessel-on-a-chip systems. In this project, you will learn different techniques to design and fabricate microchips. Then, you will use the chips to culture different endothelial cells in order to form vessels on chips. The developed vessel-on-a-chip systems will be recruited to investigate the effect of different parameters on formation of 3D tubular networks on chips.

Among these patients, there is a subset that progresses inexorably despite conventional therapy, known as progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF). Early identification of PPF is crucial for prompt initiation of antifibrotic therapy, only licensed in patients with progressive disease. It is also important for the accurate stratification of patients in clinical treatment trials. Currently no reliable means for predicting the progression of fibrosis using baseline data, meaning that patients must undergo a period of functional decline before they qualify for antifibrotic therapy. This is one of the most urgent unmet needs in the management of patients with fibrotic lung disease. In this project, we will first develop a DL-based model which makes predictions directly from the whole baseline scan followed by developing a regression model which fits the DL output using a number of identified representative CT patches that are learned automatically by an unsupervised clustering method as the explanation method. The milestone is the successful development of the prognostic model with its explanation method."

Firstly, we will assess existing XAI methods to determine which attribution methods are reliable and capable of identifying the semantic features used by the prediction model. This assessment will help us select the most suitable attribution method for our specific application. Following that, we will develop generative-based models to generate counterfactual explanations. These explanations will shed light on the reasoning behind the model's predictions by generating hypothetical scenarios that could result in different outcomes. The combination of attribution-based methods and counterfactual explanations will enhance the interpretability of DL-based prediction models.

However, expert annotation is time-consuming and highly subjective, especially for labeling large-scale 3D medical datasets. Meanwhile, fully supervised learning may restrict the model performance in some cases, for instance, noisy label scenes. To tackle the problems, unsupervised learning has gradually attracted much attention in the community of medical image analysis. For instance, innovative agent tasks of Cube Reconstruction and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have been developed. In this project, we propose an efficient and effective airway image segmentation method called parallel multi-order joint learning network (PMJL), which integrates multi-order unsupervised and supervised learning in parallel to alleviate the scarcity of labeled airway image datasets. In the branch of multi-order unsupervised learning, since (1) the normalization of different order exponential operation of raw image can enhance the contrast attribute, and (2) the features of oriented gradients can strengthen the texture feature representations in 2D space, we extend both of them to 3D space with multi-order normalized responses as targets, which is beneficial for airway image segmentation. For the supervised learning branch, it directly predicts the full segmentation map by random masked input rather than full input, which not only omits the pretrain and finetune steps but also reduces the risk of over-fitting."

In this project, we develop an effective blood vessel segmentation method called Border Rendering Feature Orthogonal (BRFO) network.

This approach focuses only on recycle-sampling vulnerable border points, rendering the serious discontinuity as well as false-negative/positive small-size vessels with two novel Multi-momentum Global-Local Fusion (MGLF) and Sparse Patched Feature Orthogonal (SPFO) modules. Furthermore, we develop a Multi-stage Self-Knowledge Distillation (MSKD) module to improve the model performance and robustness, which can also accelerate the convergence of model training.

Testosterone, a vital hormone in human and animal physiology, holds great importance in assessing hormonal imbalances, male fertility issues, drug development and so on. However, existing detection methods often involve complex labeling procedures that are time-consuming and costly.

By utilizing the distinct properties of gold-plated metal sheets as a sensing platform, this enhances the sensor's ability to detect testosterone with greater sensitivity and selectivity. By attaching specific biomolecules that interact with testosterone, we can directly measure its levels using electrochemical techniques like cyclic voltammetry or differential pulse voltammetry.

4022,"INDUSTRY, Robert Ferguson","Lab based",,,"Automatic detection of autoimmune liver diseases from MRCP images using deep learning","2025-05-19 14:41:45"," Autoimmune liver diseases (AILD) cause the body‚Äôs immune system to attack the liver, which may cause complications such as cholangitis, cirrhosis and liver failure. The most common AILD are autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) and Primary biliary Cholangitis (PBC). While they share some common characteristics, the optimal treatment varies for each disease and treatment for one disease can be detrimental to a patient with one of the others. Therefore, obtaining an accurate diagnosis is critical.

AILD is conventionally diagnosed with biopsy, which is an invasive procedure that suffers from high inter-reader variability and only samples a small part of the liver, and qualitative assessment of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP).  MRCP is an established technique that non-invasively images the biliary tree, and is routinely used by radiologists to help diagnose and monitor patients with AILD. However, qualitatively reading MRCP scans and reaching a diagnosis for AILD from them is subjective, with low inter-reader agreement. 

This project proposes to develop a tool to automatically classify MRCP images to predict the occurrence of the most common AILD, thus eliminating the inter-reader variability and reducing the need for invasive diagnostic procedures, which may pose risks such as infection or internal bleeding. Previous publications have used multi-view convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically detect PSC on MRCP, achieving impressive results. Our goal is to extend these methods to distinguish between different AILD rather than just PSC and normals. Furthermore, we also plan to compare the performance of the CNN to metrics derived from MRCP+ (Perspectum Ltd, Oxford), which produces a set of quantitative radiomic descriptors of the biliary tree from MRCP images. To evaluate the model, we will use a dataset curated by Perspectum, which contains at least 50 patients per category.

MRI techniques can be designed to be insensitive to these periodic fluctuations, by reordering the acquisition scheme to ensure that periodic signal fluctuations are instead reconstructed as unstructured noise. However, it is not clear how these schemes should be designed to optimally perform quantitative imaging in the brainstem.

In this project you will design an acquisition scheme which is insensitive to complex brain motion during high resolution brain imaging, such that you can produce quantitative maps of tissue in the brainstem. You will explore optimal encoding strategies, opportunities to exploit data redundancy to speed up acquisitions, and have the opportunity to modify the acquisition scheme directly on the MRI scanner.

The project aims to test the hypothesis that a user will build realistic expectations of a digitally archived object when haptic feedback of its abstract mechanical properties are given in addition to visual feedback compared to a case of only visual feedback. The methods involve creating an archive 3D models of a group of objects (i.e. toys) with their stiffness and roughness. The 3D models would be used in a website, that resembles popular e-commerce sites. A soft haptic mouse user interface would allow users to interactively explore the visual look of the items in the archive, while otherwise having a regular e-shopping experience. This part of the project will involve updating the existing Haptic Mouse (a device created as part of the RoboPatient project in MorphLab) to allow to portray the stiffness and roughness of the archived items. The stiffness would be shown by updating on the existing Haptic Mouse mechanism, while the roughness haptic perception would require completely new developments, likely using vibrotactile stimulation of strings woven into a fabric.

The objectives of the project

The project would aim to test if there are statistically significant differences in shopping habits, such as decision time, selling success rate and return rate, when there is a) only visual feedback and b) visual and haptic feedback. In addition, various biomarkers would be monitored to measure the user‚Äôs excitement levels to measure the possible correlation to the previously mentioned shopping characteristics. 

The methods

The stiffness and roughness of 5 items could be determined using an artificial finger that has been developed in MorphLab, while the website would be built using JavaScript or another programming language. 
A trial with 30 students would be needed to get sufficient data. There would be 3 groups: a) only visual feedback, b) only hybrid (visual and haptic) feedback, c) visual feedback followed by hybrid feedback. The user interface would collect the data on shopping habits, while an EMG, a heart rate monitor and a biomarker tracking bracelet would collect data on various biomarkers. This data would be statistically processed.

Ageing is also the biggest risk factor for a wide range of pathologies, such as diabetes, neurodegeneration, cancer and cardiovascular disease. However, the ageing process itself is still poorly understood. Recent progress with model organisms, such as the fruit fly Drosophila, has shown that genetic mutations (e.g. within evolutionary conserved nutrient-sensing pathways), environmental interventions (especially diet), and pharmacological treatments can dramatically affect lifespan.

We will use Drosophila as an in vivo model system to explore the biological mechanisms behind ageing. Our group focuses on two complementary lines of research:
1) Investigating the role of redox signalling in metabolism and ageing:
Redox signalling operates through specific post-translational modification of cysteine residues on target proteins, integrating cues from nutritional status, mitochondrial function and stress (e.g. ROS, redox cofactors), and acts as a reversible switch to regulate cellular processes. Using redox proteomic approaches and genetic redox-inactive mutants, we can manipulate redox-sensitive targets to extend lifespan and gain mechanistic insight into redox signalling in vivo.

2) Studying the impact of diet-induced obesity on lifespan:
Like humans, high sugar and high fat diets induce obesity and insulin resistance in Drosophila, and are used to model diabetic complications. These obesogenic diets also shorten lifespan, however the underlying mechanisms are complex. We use the powerful fly system to understand how diet-induced pathologies affect ageing, in order to uncover new potential therapeutic strategies for health and longevity benefits."

Description: The project involves the use of the publicly available datasets on the NinaPro database, containing information from multiple subjects performing discrete hand movements while acquiring EMG and kinematics. The student will use traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches seen in the literature to investigate how anatomical differences between subjects (i.e. weight, height, age, sex) affect the generalization performance (training on one subject and testing on another) of different methods."

However, antifungal drugs are under the growing threat of antifungal resistance1. New antifungal drugs can be tested in vitro by comparing growth rates estimated from time-course optical density (OD) data of fungal growth in different treatment conditions. However, changes in OD may not be reflective of true changes in fungal growth because OD is an indirect measure. Fungal OD data can be converted to a direct measure of growth (fungal concentration) in a process called calibration, but the collection of calibration data for fungi is not routinely feasible in clinical microbiology laboratories. 

Our group recently proposed a latent variable model that does not require calibration data to infer growth rates from OD (Hameed et al. 2024, PLoS Comp) using collected time-course OD data of fungal burden. The model treats the observed OD as distributed around a linear transform of true fungal growth and hence was able to account for OD being an indirect measure. We found that accounting for OD being an indirect measure reduced the bias of the inferred growth rates from OD compared to reference models that do not account for OD being an indirect measure. Now is the time to make this tool available to the wider experimental community. 

The aim of the project is to develop an automated tool that deploys our group‚Äôs work on estimating in vitro fungal growth rates from OD. It will make the work done by the group available to the wider fungal infection experimental community.

However, up to 60% of these investigations detect no evidence of disease, despite many of these patients having evidence an insufficient supply of blood to the myocardium. Many of these symptomatic but epicardial coronary disease free patients are thought to have disease in the microscopic vasculature of the heart known as coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD).

Our group is developing a novel MRI based technique which we believe will uniquely provide noninvasive measurements of the orientation, fractional volume and flow within the microscopic vasculature of the heart muscle without the use of exogenous contrast agents such as those based on gadolinium (MRI) and iodine (CT). This method, intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) also provides measures describing the structure of the muscle at a microscopic scale.  However, obtaining this data in-vivo human beating heart is challenging due to the constant movement of the heart.  Our group has developed a technique that overcomes the sensitivity of IVIM techniques to the motion of the heart and we have pilot data from a cohort of healthy volunteers demonstrating the feasibility of IVIM provide measures relating to microvascular perfusion. 

This project will look to advance the cardiac IVIM technique by extracting a novel measure from the data, the perfusion tensor, and performing validation of the technique is ex-vivo perfused hearts.

Effectively managing and maximually reducing the risk of injury associated with these tasks is important. Manual material handling (MMH) activities have been identified as a primary contributor to MSk disorders. Among MMH activities, lifting and lowering are two common tasks that, although seemingly similar, differ in the direction of load movement. Most ergonomic risk assessment tools have been developed exclusively for lifting activities. 

The objective of this project is to assess the kinematic and kinetic distinctions between lifting and lowering MMH activities (e.g., loads applied to the low-back and knee joints) using a previously-collected dataset. This research aims to determine the suitability of applying models developed for lifting activities to evaluate the risk of injury in lowering activities. Biomechanical modeling using OpenSim MSk models will be performed using kinematic data, force plate measurements, and electromyography (EMG) data collected for lifting and lowering MMH tasks in diverse load-moving scenarios.

In this project, we will develop novel deep generative models for multi-modality glioma MRI synthesis in order to solve the problems of incomplete multi-modal MRI acquisitions.

Cardiomyocytes have a secondary organization with aggregation across the LV wall into functional groups called sheetlets, whose reorientation and shear during contraction has been hypothesized as the mechanism translating the 15% cell shortening into the >35% wall thickening. Cardiomyocytes have different sizes throughout the LV, but their spatial variation is not known, and likewise, the dimensions, density, and distribution of sheetlets is not yet defined and the causal mechanism of contribution to heart function remains unknown. 

In vivo diffusion tensor cardiac magnetic resonance (DT-CMR) enables non-invasive and non-destructive interrogation of the three-dimensional microstructural organization of the myocardium. DT-CMR quantifies water diffusion in the myocardium, which is constrained by the myocardial micro-architecture. Diffusion aligns to the orientation of cardiomyocytes and is greater than the diffusion in the perpendicular directions, yielding information on cardiomyocyte organization. Although very promising results are arising from pioneering in vivo DT-CMR clinical studies, much remains to be understood in terms of the microstructural changes underlying cardiac disease. These questions would be best answered with optimized ex vivo DT-CMR data acquisitions, which can achieve higher spatial resolution and do not have the timing constraints of in vivo acquisitions. 

Furthermore, histological validation of DT-CMR has been limited to conventional 2D microscopy. 3D contiguous histological imaging, which combines a robotic microtome and episcopic fluorescent microscopy, has the potential to provide detailed information on the 3D micro-architecture of the human heart. So far, transmural 3D histological imaging has only been reported in mouse myocardial tissue.
The aim of this project is to develop cutting-edge 3D contiguous episcopic microscopy and ex vivo 3D DT-CMR methods to produce world- first ultra-high resolution 3D atlases of human cardiac microstructure. Ultra-high resolution 3D atlases of human cardiac microstructure will in future inform novel biomechanical models of cardiac contractile function, providing the crucial link between the macroscopic physics of myocardial contraction and the underlying microstructure and biological function of cardiomyocytes in health and disease.

The student would be involved in one or more aspects of the following overarching milestones (to be discussed with the student and tailored to their interest and the current stage/needs of the project):

1) Optimization of ex vivo DT-CMR data acquisition protocol and post-processing techniques in our clinical 3T scanner and our research 9.4T scanner. 
2) Optimization of 3D contiguous episcopic microscopy for myocardial tissue samples, using murine, swine and human samples.

The student will be based at the Cardiovascular Research Centre at the Royal Brompton Hospital and may gain experience in several techniques including how to prepare tissue samples for MRI scanning, how to use clinical (3T) and pre-clinical (9.4T) MRI scanners for ex vivo imaging, and how to post-process the acquired data. The student may also gain experience in cutting edge microscopy, including tissue perfusion (fixation and staining), episcopic imaging and 3D data post-processing. This is a unique opportunity to work in the leading group for in vivo DT-CMR and contribute in a meaningful way towards the development of these techniques. Post processing software includes MATLAB and Python tools, so students may further their programming skills in these languages.

A muscle's mechanical output is limited by the force it can exert across different shortening lengths and velocities, and these physiological and mechanical limitations constrain animal performance, behaviour, and evolution. Muscle action is transmitted to the environment via skeletal elements, but rarely do muscle and skeleton connect directly. Instead, muscle action is mediated via tendons, aponeuroses (in vertebrates), or apodemes (in invertebrates). Although these elements are non-contractile---and thus can neither generate force nor do mechanical work---their presence is thought to bring great functional benefits to musculoskeletal performance. 

During running, energy that would otherwise be lost as heat can be transiently stored in form of elastic strain energy in stretched tendons, reducing the need for muscle work, and so presumably the expense of metabolic energy; upon impulsive loading, tendons may act as shock absorbers that protect muscle fibres from critical damage; tendons can significantly enhance muscle mechanical output during explosive movements, because the speed of elastic recoil is not restricted by the otherwise limiting force-velocity relationship of muscle; and the rapid elastic response of tendons can passively stabilise movements against unpredictable perturbations on time scales much faster than achievable via the nervous system, and simplify necessary control strategies. Without doubt, placing appropriately tuned elastic elements in-series with muscle can have diverse and significant benefits. The mechanical properties of \emph{vertebrate} tendons have consequently been the subject of a substantial body of work. Perhaps surprisingly, much less is known about the mechanical properties of the invertebrate analogue: apodemes. The literature contains tendon data for upwards of 40 vertebrate species, covering a large range of body sizes, clades and ecological niches. In sharp contrast, only two reports on the mechanical properties of invertebrate apodemes exist to the best of the authors‚Äôs knowledge---both on the same species, and both published about half a century ago.

In this project, you will further develop a novel method based on beam resonance to extract the mechanical properties of tiny insect apodemes. Successful project completion may enable you to present your work at an international conference, and, if luck permits, perhaps even write a publication.

Recent neurophysiological evidence suggests that flies anticipate the sensory consequences of their actions (a so-called forward model) to prevent stabilization reflexes from occurring in response to volitional movements.
 
In theory, this forward model must adapt to account for variable neuronal delays and changes in the sensory environment. This project will test this hypothesis by measuring the electrophysiological responses of motion sensitive interneurons in the fly brain whilst the fly is walking within a closed-loop virtual reality platform with control over the latency of sensory feedback.

This project will involve dissecting flies to access the brain whilst they walk on a spherical treadmill; extracellular electrophysiology of motion sensitive neurons during walking; data analysis in Matlab or Python. Programming experience is useful but can be learned as part of the project.

The purpose of this project is to develop a deep neural network or beam forming algorithms that can reconstruct the location of acoustic sources using multiple microphones.

Motivation. In therapeutic ultrasound, a focused ultrasound transducer is used to concentrate energy to a point in the body, allowing us to noninvasively and locally manipulate tissue (tumour ablation, drug release from acoustically-active particles, etc). Our laboratory developed therapeutic ultrasound devices for delivering drugs to the brain (across the blood-brain barrier) for the treatment of brain cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and other neurological conditions. However, the success or failure of the technique has been difficult to track as clinicians are unable to directly observe what is happening within the body. An emerging way of monitoring this procedure is with the use of microphones located around the focused ultrasound transducer. Sound generated during the procedure are captured by the microphones. We then reconstruct an image of the treated area using passive beamforming algorithms. The reconstruction of a signal source based on multiple sensor signals is broadly known as beamforming. In addition to medical imaging, it is used in underwater acoustics, astronomy, and other disciplines. The problem with many existing passive beamforming algorithms is the poor spatial resolution in the reconstruction of the sound sources. This means we can't precisely locate where the source is coming from.

The purpose of this project is to develop a deep neural network and/or signal processing methods that can reconstruct an image of the treated region with better accuracy and spatial resolution.

Work description. This work will involve generating training data using computer simulations on a Matlab toolbox known as k-wave. We will then train the deep neural network on PyTorch or develop fundamental signal processing algorithms. We will explore conventional neural networks such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and others; and, potentially, more advanced techniques, such as transformers and physics-inspired neural networks."

When diseased, the heart can adapt a different shape, for example, it becomes thicker and rounder with obtructive heart failure, and it becomes elongated with valve regurgitation. During disease, it also moves differently, for example, during cardiomyopathy, contractile motions are reduced. So far, there has been partial success at using machine learning to detect diseases from cardiac images such as echo and MRI (diagnosis), but there's been only 1 recent paper in a top journal showing that deep learning processing of cardiac motion predict outcomes of the patient better than doctors can (better prognosis). We ask the question, whether we can combine the shape and the motion of the heart to better predict its outcomes? We will first refine deep learning tools in the lab to create a neural network algorithm to extract the shape and motion of the heart from MRI images, using echocardiography images from a large database from Imperial NHS.  We will use a graph fourier approach to describe the 3D shape and motion of the heart. We will then create a network to use shape and motion features to predict all-cause-mortality from the large database. Being able to predict risks of poor outcomes can help doctors figure out which patients to single out for better monitoring and care, and this can potentially reduce deaths and improve outcomes.   "

Implement optical hand tracking using machine learning, analyse speed and bottlenecks, and explore ways of improving existing methods.

Motivation. Optical hand tracking is a method used in virtual reality, augmented reality, and human-machine interfacing as it allows the user to interact with virtual environments and communicate with robots and machines in a natural way. However, optical hand tracking has not been able to achieve widespread adoption due to limitations in speed and precision, and a constant breaking of the immersive experience.

The purpose of this project is to analyse existing optical hand tracking methods and quantify their speed, precision, and failure rates; and explore ways of improving the optical hand tracking performance.

Work. The student will setup their own optical hand tracking setup using a camera (e.g., a webcam) and write his/her own optical hand tracking method from scratch using python and PyTorch. The student will then improve the algorithm using the state-of-the-art published algorithms and quantify the speed, precision, and failure rates of all of these methods. The student will evaluate the bottlenecks in each of these categories. For example, what is the physical, hardware, or computational reasons for these limitations. Certainly the speed of light is fast and so is not constraining the speed of calculations. Perhaps it's the two-step process of identifying where the hand is in the image and the subsequent steps of identifying where the hand joints are located? Is the constraint due to the hardware's calculation speeds? We will explore these questions and many others. The students will learn how to approach a common machine learning problem with the deep analytical abilities of an academic researcher.

Create a physical object in the real world that can be tracked in the virtual world with speed and accuracy

Motivation. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) provide an infinite world that users can interact with. In many applications, we would like to project our real-world body (hands, legs, etc.) and objects (a ball, stick, cup, etc.) into the virtual space. However, current methods still remain slow, clunky, and inaccurate, breaking the immersive experience that we hope for and creating a disconcerting feeling when using VR and AR. What are the current methods for tracking objects and what are the physical, hardware, and computational limitations? How can we improve upon these limitations?

Work. You are tasked with building a physical object that includes trackable sensors: infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and inertial measurement units (IMUs). The IMU provides very fast positional tracking (1,000's of Hz), but suffers from poor accuracy over time. The infrared LEDs provide highly accurate tracking, but is slow (10's of Hz). We will therefore provide fast tracking with IMU that is corrected by the infrared LEDs over time. This combined IMU + infrared LED tracking provides a rapid and accurate method of tracking objects. The object's position will be recreated in a virtual world using Unity. The speed and accuracy will be quantified. You will then explore ways of improving upon key limitations with this method, such as tracking out of the field of view, or adding capabilities, such as user feedback with haptic vibration motors."

This project will involve simulating the model to probe one of several possible systems, including a design for a molecular force sensor, and a strand displacement system showing anomalous kinetics, providing understanding of the basic biophysics and linking the observed phenomena to other contexts. 

An eagerness to learn basic coding in languages such as c++/python is necessary for this project.

We recently installed one of the first of a new generation of MRI scanner with ~5x the gradient strength of typical scanners (Siemens Cima.X). This next generation of scanners are ideal for acquiring diffusion tensor data. 

Our group has been at the forefront of the development of diffusion tensor cardiovascular magnetic resonance techniques worldwide for over a decade. One key barrier to translation of these techniques on high performance MRI hardware to the clinic is the inability to distinguish signal originating from the fast moving blood from the signal in the heart muscle, meaning that data from the edges of the heart where pixels contain a mixture of both blood and muscle must be excluded from our analyses. In this project we will use computational modelling and in-vivo validation in a small cohort of healthy volunteers to isolate the two signal components and provide measures of the diffusion tensor across the whole wall of the left ventricle in the hearts of healthy volunteers and patients.

The student will develop skills in computational modelling, data analysis, medical image analysis, MRI and diffusion imaging. "

An imbalanced skin microbiome, known as dysbiosis, is associated with conditions ranging from eczema3 to acne4. Despite the growing body of skin microbiome data deposited in public databases5, identifying the key microbes driving skin health and disease remains a challenge due to the high variability in skin microbiome compositions across studies6. This project aims to integrate data from multiple studies to identify the key microbes driving skin health and disease (e.g., eczema and psoriasis) by using statistical and machine learning approaches to untangle complex relationships within the skin microbiome. Identifying the key microbes driving skin health and disease will advance the development of data-informed in silico models of the skin microbiome.

In skin diseases such as eczema (atopic dermatitis, AD), the skin microbiome becomes imbalanced (dysbiosis) [2] and this may reduce its support of the immune system. This may be driven by a change in skin conditions, which selectively reduces the abundance of the ‚Äúprotective‚Äù bacteria, in turn enabling the proliferation of pathogens and exacerbation of the skin disease [3]. We hypothesise that adding back the ‚Äúprotective‚Äù bacterial species, or engineering other skin bacteria for the synthesis of immune-modulating molecules (as an engineered probiotic), we can support the recovery of the skin from the disease state. Identifying potential therapeutic molecules and how they modulate the skin‚Äôs immune system will help develop live bacterial therapies for skin diseases such as eczema.

The aim of this project is to identify skin immune-modulating molecules, what they target and its effect, and which bacteria produce them, through a literature search. "

Soil is a highly complex environment populated by countless organism. As an ecosystem of plants, microorganisms and microfauna, it is essential for all forms of life, as it is responsible for sustaining all other forms of terrestrial diversity [1]. Yet up to 80 % of the bacteria found in soil are dormant [2]. Many of these dormant organisms form spores, specialized cell structures resistant to harsh conditions such as desiccation and chemical attacks [3, 4].
 
Understanding how microorganisms in the soil microbiome respond to water shortages is becoming increasingly crucial as climate change is predicted to heighten the frequency and severity of droughts worldwide [5]. However, while some researchers speculate that spore formation might explain changes in growth and metabolic rates observed in bacteria following droughts [6], the role of sporulation remains unclear. A better understanding of bacterial drought responses, including the role of sporulation and germination, could pave the way for important applications in bioremediation and ecosystem recovery.

Project: 
A drought-on-a-chip system will be established using polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions [7, 8] to simulate low water potentials within poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic devices. A device in which bacterial cells or spores can be confined [9], exposed to a variety of micro-environments, and imaged with high resolution can then be used to characterise the sporulation and germination response of Bacillus subtilis under drought conditions. 

The project would suit a student with an interest in microbiology, microfluidics and microscopy, and can involve bacterial cell culture, microscopy, image analysis and computational modelling (optional), as well as fabrication and handling of PDMS microfluidic devices. 

The project will be supervised by Dr Claire Stanley and Maria Portela in the Department of Bioengineering.

Organoids require a 3D matrix to enable their growth and maturity.  The most widely used matrix is Matrigel which is an undefined matrix derived from mouse tumour basement membrane.  Although Matrigel supports the growth of organoids from a variety of tissue types, the undefined and xenogeneic nature of this gel renders it unsuitable for understanding cell-matrix interactions and improving organoid growth. Therefore, a fully synthetic hydrogel would enable detailed studies of organoid-matrix interactions to improve 3D culture protocols. There are many different matrix properties that influence organoid culture, including stiffness, stress relaxation and degradability. With high-throughput screening methods, a wide range of hydrogels can be tested simultaneously to rapidly assess and identify bioinstructive hydrogels as candidates for organoid culture. We are preparing a dynamic hydrogel library for screening materials for organoid culture. Dynamic materials comprise polymers with reversible crosslinks to form hydrogels with varying stiffness and viscoelasticity. In this project, polymers with chemical modifications will be prepared and printed in high throughput to form a hydrogel library. After that, the hydrogel library will be screened to identify candidate materials as organoid culture matrices."

The common methods to direct stem cell differentiation are to expose the cells to specific signaling pathways modulators (i.e. growth factors and cytokines) and extracellular matrix. While much research went into developing these protocols, the nature of these agents is controversial, and therefore translation to clinical uses is usually prohibited. 

In previous studies, I identified another potential route to control stem cell differentiation purely through physical means that would eliminate the concerns with using growth factors and cytokines. By exposing stem cells to the nano topography of desired cell type tissue, the nanostructure contains sufficient information to direct specified differentiation (i.e. tendon tissue nano topography for tenocyte differentiation, spinal cord tissue nano topography for neuron differentiation). These nano topographies can be captured on cell culture substrates through different fabrication methods. I also showed that it is possible to replicate nanostructure-induced cell behavior change by creating a generalized template of these structures.

Knowing this, the next question would be: If we systematically alter the properties of the generalized template, to what extent would the cell behavior change stop? 

The project aims are therefore: 
a)	To select and design the process of a suitable nanofabrication method that is robust with good resolution (to capture the nano topographies) and compatible with use with biological systems.
b)	To identify the working range of nano topographical features and ultimately identify the effective properties and what are the actual ‚Äòsignals‚Äô within these nanostructures.

Typically these settings require vast numbers of external fixators suddenly (examples include the first days of the war in Ukraine, or the Feb 2023 earthquake in Turkiye/Syria).

This is entitled ""surge capacity"".

Imperial College has developed an external fixator for local manufacture that has already demonstrated surge capacity provision in Ukraine, with clinical trials in Gaza and Sri Lanka. This device requires minimal machining and, with little training, can be made fairly easily.

However, even the minimal amount of machining requires a lathe. What is the solution if a lathe is not available? 

There is some evidence that 3d printing of components of an external fixator could provide a functional external fixator. The aim of this project is to design, prototype and test an external fixator with 3d printed components.

The student will also evaluate the model with other performance metrics and apply it to other sets of molecules provided by the supervisor (thus, independency in running code such as python scripts is required).

This project is an opportunity to be introduce to an important drug discovery problem, the best AI models to tackle this problem and hone your programming skills.

There is a plethora of structure-based AI models designed for this application. However, typically few of them release code that can be used on other sets of molecules. More importantly, we currently do not have any way to anticipate which of the available models to employ for a given target.
The supervisor will provide targets with their structures and sets of molecules known to bind to those targets (i.e. binding molecules or binders). For each of the targets, the student will review the literature to introduce the target and find structure-based AI models for virtual screening (i.e. to discriminate between binders and non-binders in a given set of molecules). The student will evaluate the models to find out which is the most effective for the target. Some strategies to anticipate which is the best model will be evaluated (e.g. calculating the similarities between the considered targets and those included in the training set of that model). Thus, independence in running code such as Python scripts is required.

EVs play very important roles in cancer and metastasis including promoting the adhesion, migration, invasion and growth of metastastising tumour cells. EVs are commonly found in blood and therefore may  be very useful for minimally invasive early diagnosis of cancer. 

EVs contain distinct surface markers and payload which may be used one day to determine what type of cancer an individual has and help select which therapeutic approach is best for an individual patient. To one day achieve a ""pan-cancer"" method of cancer diagnosis from blood, we wish to first explore a ""multicancer"" approach to cancer diagnosis. BRCA is a gene which drives a much higher risk of breast and ovarian cancer when women inherent mutations to this gene. Some women with BRCA mutations can have both breast and ovarian cancers at the same time. This makes it an excellent initial model for multicancer diagnosis because blood samples can be taken from the subset of women known to carry BRCA mutations for routine screening. The challenge however, is how to best isolate these small particles from the blood of cancer patients and then subsequently use these particles for simultaneous breast and ovarian cancer diagnosis?  

The goal of this ambitious project is to microfluidic device that a) isolates EVs from whole blood and b) determine if these EVs are derived from breast and/or ovarian cancer. While many methods of EV isolation are currently under investigation, an inertial based method that uses wall lift effects is particularly suited for the physical isolation of EVs in ways that do not modify their characteristics: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi5296 . Isolated EVs will then be combined with techniques such as immunohistochemistry or mass spectrometry to classify EVs to move us towards a blood-based screen for the diagnosis of multiple cancer types at once. 

Students will gain valuable skills in microfluidic device design, CAD, microfabrication, cancer cell culture, molecular biology and imaging. "

However, this also means that Hearables are prone to artefacts arising from the relative movement between the sensors and the ear-canal, for example, due to walking, chewing or talking. To this end, it is possible to use  motion-related signals from the accelerometer and microphone within the Hearables device, which can serve as a reference in an artefact-removal algorithm - subject of this FYP. In addition, owing to their discreet and earplug-mounted nature, the development of Hearables specifically for 24/7 physiological monitoring opens the avenue of using even unwanted signals (artefacts) as sources of information, to e.g infer behavioural cues [3,4].
The project aims are as follows: 1) Record in-ear physiological signals such as ECG, EEG and PPG in the presence of motion artefacts.  2) Extract relevant information and features from the recorded data to capture the variations of the artefacts. 3) Design and implement machine learning tools for artefact removal, and for their classification. 4) Search for patterns in the artefacts and classify different types of behaviour based on these artefacts.

Motivation: Certain phenomena, such as ultrasound imaging and therapy with microbubbles (contrast agents) operate in the MHz rate. Such fast dynamics cannot be captured using traditional cameras, which operate at around 60 Hz. Commercially available cameras can reach 1 million frames per second, which is still not enough. And while a 10 million frames per second camera is available on the market for ¬£200k, that camera cannot capture more than 256 frames (25.6¬µs of data). We propose a new video camera concept that could reach up to 50 million frames per second, capable of capturing nearly unlimited amounts of frames. By creating this device, we would be able to observe phenomena in biological tissue that no one has been able to observe.

Outside of the domain of biomedical engineering, this camera could be used to image plasma in fusion reactors, high-speed objects in space, and other high-speed phenomena that requires incredibly high frame rates.

Work: This project requires electrical engineering skills. The students would be asked to make circuits that are connected to a unique sensor array. If the analog circuit is successful, we would then require some digital electronics skillsets and optics (physics)."

The way this technology works is by first injecting clinically-approved microbubbles and drugs into the bloodstream. When the microbubbles reach the area where the ultrasound is targeted in the brain, these bubbles oscillate, mechanically stimulating the blood vessels, allowing the barrier to open so that drugs can get reach the brain. 

This technology has generated a lot of excitement as the blood-brain barrier currently prevents over 98% of drugs from entering the brain. Therefore, this technique can allow drugs that have previously failed clinical trials due to this barrier, to be tested again. This project will involve testing a range of drugs against low-grade glioma brain tumours to see which might be most effective in vitro. We will then select the best drug combinations to test in vivo in a mouse model of the disease. 

In this project, you will explore with cell culture, assays, sectioning, staining and fluorescence microscopy the effect of different drugs against low-grade glioma cells and tumours. Focused ultrasound will be used to deliver these drugs in the in vivo models. "

The others are often kept in the hospital for a day or more, going through various tests several times, as doctors want to be very sure before they let them go home. This is because being wrong about letting them can be potentially dangerous, if they really have a heart attack and we send them home wrongly, they can die. However, keeping all these people who are not really sick around takes up a lot of hospital resources, waste a lot of money the hospital doesn't have, and hogs onto hospital beds and doctors/nurses' time when they really should be caring for really sick people. 

We recently developed an ML algorithm that calculates whether a patient really have heart attack, based on their medical history and their initial blood test (troponin and others) results. It can safely rule out 50% more patients compared to current clinical practice that follows guidelines, leading to early discharge of these patients back home, and in the ruled-out cohort, there is a lower error rate. Our algorithm won an award at the British Cardiovascular Society Conference, and now we are planning for clinical trials and commercialization. 

Here, the project for the student is to refine the model: First, testing if attention-based ML model does better than our existing algorithm, second, use imputative deep learning models to address cases where there are some missing data (common in the clinic). Student will work with a PhD student and a team of Cardiologists (Dr. Amit Kaura, and Prof. Jamil Mayet) on this. They can also interface with a Malaysian team also trying to test and roll out our algorithm in Malaysia.

Curiously, available data has it that animals become more efficient as they grow in size: the ratio between energy output (muscle mechanical work) and system input (metabolic energy) increases in heavier animals. It is clear enough that something is amiss, because extrapolation of this trend suggests that large extinct animals (dinosaurs!) moved with an efficiency larger than unity; but the origin of this paradox remains at large. In this project, you will take a bioengineering perspective on this open problem, and analyse muscle as a thermodynamic machine. You will build on recent thermodynamical and mechanical models of muscle performance to derive a prediction for the efficiency of muscle as a function of animal size, and compare this prediction to existing data.

Notably, these changes include gene expression shifts indicative of a transition toward a more mesenchymal phenotype (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11208511/#Sec12).
The primary aim of this project is to determine whether after passing though microfluidic models of capillaries, tumor cells also undergo functional changes that influence their ability to promote transmigration across endothelial monolayers and induce endothelial damage. This will be assessed using an in vitro transwell model which will be used to perform transmigration assays of malignant breast tumor cells across endothelial monolayers.
Specifically, the objectives are to:
a) Use microfluidic devices to induce shear stress‚Äìmediated shedding and fragmentation of tumor cells.
b) Employ in vitro assays to evaluate if the gene expression changes that follow passage through the microfluidic device affect the ability of tumor cells to cause endothelial damage.
c) Investigate whether endothelial damage is mediated through activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and explore potential therapeutic avenues (inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathways using the C176 inhibitor).

These represent a novel subclass of large extracellular vesicles (EVs) generated through mechanical shear forces experienced during CTC migration. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) ‚Äîlipid bilayer-enclosed nanostructures transporting nucleic acids, proteins, and other biomolecules‚Äîare instrumental in cancer progression by modulating tumor cell adhesion, migration, invasion, and the establishment of metastatic niches. Their stability and detectability in peripheral blood render EVs attractive candidates for minimally invasive liquid biopsy strategies aimed at early cancer diagnosis and disease monitoring. The identification of shearosomes establishes a direct mechanistic link between the biomechanical properties of CTCs and EV biogenesis, providing new avenues to explore how mechanical stresses during metastasis give rise to functionally specialized vesicle populations with potential diagnostic utility.
Compared to other extracellular vesicle subclasses such as exosomes, shearosomes are substantially larger‚Äîmeasuring up to 10 ¬µm‚Äîand exhibit considerable structural and compositional complexity. Their diameter exceeds that of capillaries, supporting the hypothesis that shearosomes may undergo further fragmentation either spontaneously or when traversing narrow capillary vessels.
This project aims to elucidate whether shearosomes undergo further shedding and fragmentation into smaller EVs, either spontaneously or as a result of mechanical stress during passage through capillary-like constrictions. The study will employ microfluidics, in vitro cell culture, and ex vivo samples to investigate the biology and biomechanics of shearosomes. Specifically, the objectives are to:
a)‚ÄØUse microfluidic devices to generate first-pass shearosomes under controlled shear conditions.
b)‚ÄØEmploy in vitro cell culture systems to assess the lifespan of shearosomes and determine whether they spontaneously release smaller EVs over time.
c)‚ÄØUse microfluidic devices to simulate sequential capillary constrictions and evaluate whether additional mechanical stress induces further fragmentation into smaller vesicles. 
d)‚ÄØApply molecular biology techniques to characterize the composition of the resulting smaller particles and compare them to their parent shearosomes.

Neurodisability is an umbrella term that covers multiple neurodevelopmental conditions, most commonly cerebral palsy. Neurodisability generally results in decreased ambulation due to abnormal motion and muscle stresses, which leads to reduced bone mass and increased risk of low bone mineral density (BMD). Therefore, children with neurodisability have an increased risk of fracture. Weight-bearing leads to loading of the bones, which is essential for promoting bone strength, increasing BMD and therefore decreasing the risk of fractures. It is common for children with limited ambulation to rely on assistive technologies, such as standing devices, to facilitate weight-bearing. While standing devices are designed to allow weight-bearing for children with neurodisability, how effectively they do this remains unclear.
This project will involve the use of musculoskeletal models to quantify muscle and joint forces during the use of a range of standing devices and standing factors. Data previously collected with an Xsens system will be available for analysis.

Large EVs (LEVs, >200 nm) are of particular interest due to their larger cargo capacity and distinct biological roles, offering significant potential in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. The unique biogenesis pathways and functional relevance of LEVs, such as ""shearosomes"" (1-11 ¬µm), a novel class of large extracellular vesicles discovered by our research group (Vrynas et al., 2025) https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202506339, which are generated by circulating tumor cells under shear stress in capillary bifurcations which can activate endothelial and immune cells, further highlight their importance.

However, the widespread application of LEVs is hindered by challenges in their production, including low natural secretion yields (e.g., exosome yields can be less than 1 ¬µg of protein per million cells over 24 hours (Yoon et al., 2015)), difficulties in controlling their size, and limitations in scalability of current methods (Syromiatnikova et al., 2022). Existing microfluidic techniques often focus on smaller EVs, may damage vesicles, or lack precise LEV size tunability. For instance, simple cell extrusion through narrow microchannels typically generates nanovesicles (60-120 nm) (Jo et al., 2014), and other methods like those involving squeezing ridges are primarily optimized for small EV (sEV) production (Hao et al., 2023) rather than explicitly designed for high-yield, size-controlled production of LEVs.

This project aims to develop a novel microfluidic device to address these challenges, enabling enhanced production and tunable size control of LEVs. The device will feature a narrow microchannel (smaller than cell size) that gently squeezes cells. Integrated along this channel will be an array of small side expansion structures. As cells are squeezed through the main channel and pass these expansion areas, the induced mechanical stress and subsequent pressure changes are hypothesized to cause the cell membrane to shed, forming an LEV in the expansion zone, a mechanism that builds upon principles of mechanically induced vesiculation (Jo et al., 2014; Hao et al., 2023). A key hypothesis is that the size of the LEVs can be precisely controlled by tailoring the geometry (e.g., area or volume) of these side expansion structures. This approach draws inspiration from observations of vesicle shedding under mechanical stress, such as shear-induced LEV formation (Vrynas et al., 2025) or membrane slicing (Yoon et al., 2015), but aims for a more direct and controllable generation mechanism localized at the expansion areas.

This innovative approach is expected to significantly improve LEV production yields and offer unprecedented control over LEV size, which is crucial for optimizing their therapeutic efficacy and for research applications. Compared to existing methods that may damage vesicles or offer limited control over LEV populations (Syromiatnikova et al., 2022), this device aims for a gentler, more controlled generation process. The produced LEVs will be characterized using standard techniques such as Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), and electron microscopy to confirm size, morphology, and concentration, and Western Blotting for marker confirmation, following established protocols for EV characterization.

Students will gain valuable skills in: microfluidic device design, computational modeling (e.g., CAD, CFD), soft lithography microfabrication, mammalian cell culture, and a range of advanced nanoparticle characterization techniques including NTA, DLS, electron microscopy, and Western blotting.

Notably, although enhancers can be separated from the genes they control by millions of base pairs, they are often found in close proximity in the cell due to 3D chromosomal contacts.  The strength of enhancer-gene interactions is driven by topological and geometrical considerations, and multiple enhancers often control the same gene. Recent experimental breakthroughs provide ever more quantitative data on how changes in enhancer activity or genomic location affect gene expression [2,3,4] , but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear [5]. At a deeper level, it is not clear what additional biological advantage is obtained by having transcriptional regulation function in this way.

In this project, the student will take simple mathematical models [3,6] developed for an engineered locus, where a single enhancer controls a reporter gene, and extend them to the more typical scenarios, where genes are controlled by multiple enhancers. The student will apply basic simulation and theory to understand the possible behaviours of such models, and then explore whether these behaviours are presented in experimentally derived datasets [3,4]. They will look to identify biologically beneficial modes of action in the observed behaviour.

This project is well-suited to students interested in mathematical and computational modelling, simulation and the analysis of large datasets. The project will be performed in collaboration with Mikhail Spivakov from the MRC Laboratory of Medical Sciences (MRC LMS) at the Hammersmith Hospital campus.

We however have limited ability to generate shearosomes from cells in culture because the relative sizes of tumour cells and bifurcations need to be matched to generate LEVS at high throughput. This is because cells that are too large end up clogging microfluidic bifurcations, and cells that are too small end up passing through without shearosome generation. Thus, there is a middle ground that is optimal for shearosome generation. 

This project aims to adapt a novel microfluidic device engineered in our group to address this challenge. We will use determinsitic latereal displacement (DLD), a ""pachinko""-like sorting technique to separate tumour cells into size buckets. More details about this technique can be found here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-01150-3. 
These size-sorted tumour cells of distinct known sizes will then be sent to bifurcations with optimal dimensions from which shearosomes will be generated.  

This approach will increase the number and throughput of shearosomes produced in the laboratory, and allow us to study the impact of these shearosome vesicles on metastatic progression, cancer outcomes, and as diagnostic or therapeutic tools.

As its use expands in applications such as molecular recording, sensing, and programmable self-assembly [2], there is growing interest in designing multiple PER hairpin systems that can operate in parallel without unintended cross-reactivity [3]. Achieving this functionality requires careful control over sequence orthogonality ‚Äì the ability for each PER unit to function independently and selectively.

This project will investigate how the design of PER hairpins and primers can be tuned to maximise orthogonality across a multi-component system. It will explore how restricting nucleotide composition (e.g. using only three out of the four bases: A, T, C, G, as is helpful for a single PER system) affects the potential to generate distinct, non-interacting PER reactions within the same environment. The aim is to better understand the sequence design limits that govern orthogonality and inform future applications involving complex PER networks.

Aims and Objectives:

¬∑ To explore how sequence design and nucleotide composition influence the orthogonality of PER hairpin systems.

¬∑ To assess the compatibility of multiple PER systems operating in parallel without interference.

¬∑ To evaluate whether constrained base alphabets can support distinct and separable product strands.

Approach: The project will make use of computational tools for DNA sequence design and analysis. Sequence candidates will be generated and tested for potential cross-reactivity using thermodynamic models. The number and characteristics of compatible PER systems will be assessed under different design constraints, such as restricted base usage or structural layout. Where appropriate, tools such as NUPACK4 will be used to assess secondary structure formation, base-pairing energies, and unintended hybridisation. Broader exploratory strategies will help to evaluate orthogonality across multiple sequence combinations and identify limits to system scalability. When a suitable set of candidate sequences have been identified, they will be tested in wet-lab experiments.

Expected Outcomes: The project will provide insights into how many PER hairpin systems can coexist without interference and how sequence design rules can be adapted to increase system capacity. It will contribute to ongoing efforts to develop scalable, multi-step DNA reaction networks and inform future experimental implementations.

Relevance to Research Context: This project aligns with broader goals in DNA nanotechnology and molecular systems engineering, particularly the design of dynamic, programmable networks that operate under non-equilibrium conditions. Understanding orthogonality in PER systems supports the development of more complex, reliable tools for synthetic biology, diagnostics, and information processing.

As an advancement of this technology, we recently developed handhold-mediated strand displacement (HMSD), which introduces an additional binding domain, referred to as the handhold [3,4]. This mechanism enables transient interactions between the strands and facilitates the production of out-of-equilibrium reaction products.

However, experimental observations revealed that the HMSD mechanism can sometimes still be triggered even with low complementarity in the handhold region. We hypothesize that partial binding between the complementary handhold on one strand strand and a separate part of the invading strand could act as a templating interaction, facilitating strand displacement. This unintended templating effect can cause unwanted reactions in certain system designs, but may also be an alternative strategy for deliberately accelerating strand displacement if considered during the design process.

To investigate this hypothesis, the student will employ the computational tool NUPACK to design DNA systems that test whether this reaction mechanism does indeed explain the results, and explore its properties. These systems will then be experimentally tested using a fluorescence plate reader to measure real-time reaction kinetics.

These molecular systems perform computations using molecules and chemical reactions, enabling information processing and computation in environments where electronics are impractical.

A key mechanism in this field is toehold-mediated strand displacement (TMSD), which underlies many breakthroughs in DNA-based nanotechnology [1]. By combining large numbers of DNA ""gates"" that rely on TMSD, researchers have built chemical systems capable of implementing digital logic [2], neural network algorithms [3], and temporal information processing [4]. The logic of these molecular programs is governed by the reaction rate of the TMSD process.

This reaction rate can be tuned by modifying the DNA sequence in a specific region called the toehold. However, predicting the reaction rate in advance, by designing toehold sequences with desired kinetics, remains a major challenge. Current biophysical models and machine learning techniques have not yet provided accurate solutions to this problem. This lack of ability to reliably fine-tune kinetics limits the application of DNA strand displacement to non-equilibrium systems that are governed by reaction kinetics. 

To overcome this problem, we propose a modular design in which all toeholds are variants on a single sequence, with different numbers of mismatched base pairs used to control reaction kinetics [5]. To this end, we aim develop a database of partially mismatched sequences with experimentally verified reaction rates to be used in general molecular programming applications. The project involves refining and experimentally testing the DNA strand displacement designs, using both: NuPack: a computational tool for DNA sequence design [6,7], and Laboratory techniques for measuring DNA strand displacement kinetics.

It is a cornerstone of modern machine learning and has recently become much more accessible due to high-performance AD libraries such as JAX [1], which allow automatic and efficient computation of gradients even for complicated numerical programs.

Researchers in synthetic biology and molecular programming have begun applying AD to problems in system design, optimization, and simulation [2-5]. However, many commonly used algorithms in this space are not naturally differentiable due to their discrete or stochastic nature. For example, the well-known Gillespie algorithm (used in modelling stochastic chemical kinetics [6]) is discontinuous and thus not directly compatible with AD. Recent efforts have successfully developed continuous, differentiable approximations to such algorithms, enabling their use in differentiable programming frameworks [2].

The Principles of Biomolecular Systems group works at the interface of DNA nanotechnology and theoretical biomolecular systems, developing both experimental platforms and mathematical models for understanding and engineering molecular processes. In the context of this project, we are particularly interested in Monte Carlo methods used to simulate and optimize self-assembling biomolecular systems. One such method, the Virtual Move Monte Carlo (VMMC) algorithm [7], is used to simulate systems where interactions between particles lead to complex collective motions.
Our aim is to develop a differentiable version of VMMC that can be incorporated into optimization pipelines for biomolecular system design. This would enable us to apply gradient-based techniques to optimize the structure or behaviour of molecular assemblies, including models like oxDNA [8], a coarse-grained simulation platform for DNA nanotechnology.

We are seeking a motivated student to work on:
- Designing and implementing a differentiable approximation of the VMMC algorithm using JAX or similar tools.
- Testing the new algorithm on simplified biomolecular systems to demonstrate its ability to optimize structural properties.

The project will involve a combination of programming, algorithm design, and application to biophysical models. It provides an opportunity to contribute to a novel research direction at the intersection of machine learning, simulation, and synthetic biology.

Tools & Techniques:
- Programming with Python and JAX
- Concepts from numerical modelling and stochastic simulation
This project would suit students with interests in computational biology, optimization, or molecular systems.

Typically, light scattering is the main reason why we can't see through things, and scattering is caused by microscale inhomogeneities in refractive index. By exploiting a mathematical relationship called the Kramers Kronig relations, we can now tune the refractive index of an object until it matches that of the rest of the local environment, making it essentially invisible.

What the vast majority of people have failed to notice is that rather than just flooding a tissue with another medium to change its bulk refractive index, photopatterning can change the refractive index locally, allowing us to *remove* the refractive index differences, rather than just minimising them.

The student will use the multiphoton microscope in the Rowlands lab to selectively photobleach a dye that has been infused in to a tissue, in an attempt to demonstrate that the refractive index can be changed to whatever value the user desires. This will involve wetlab work, potentially some programming and hardware design, and potentially even work with live tissues if the project is that successful.

-----------------------
Background: 
Bacteria in the soil perform vital ecological functions. Faced with harsh conditions, some types of bacteria form spores, specialized dormant cells with reduced metabolic activity and arrested growth. When environmental conditions become favourable again, some of these spores germinate, and resume their metabolic functions [1]. Because of the crucial role bacteria play in soil health, a better understanding of bacterial spore germination dynamics could lead to important applications in sustainable agriculture, food security and biotechnology.

Microfluidic tools, when combined with microscopy, offer a promising tool to monitor spore germination dynamics in real time. However, current methodologies to analyse spore germination videos, such as SporeTrackerX [2] and PySpore [3], have large error rates and require significant manual curation. Emerging machine learning tools offer a promising solution to overcome these issues and build automated and accurate analysis pipelines. However, generalist deep learning models for microbiology, such as DeLTA 2.0 [4], weren‚Äôt trained on spore images and therefore show poor performance on spore germination datasets. 

Project: 
This project aims to address a gap in the literature by building an automated image analysis deep learning pipeline. This pipeline should be capable of a) accurate segmentation and b) cell tracking of microbial spores, and it may combine key features from existing tools and adapt them to suit spore data, by re-training and fine-tuning the chosen models. It should also extract biologically relevant metrics such as cell size and position over time, as well as identify key germination events. A dataset of spore germination videos obtained using a spore-on-a-chip microfluidic platform [5] will be provided for training and testing the pipeline, and further data may be acquired by the student if needed.

The project will suit a student with interest and relevant experience in computer vision using deep learning, and software development. The project will be supervised by Dr Claire Stanley and Maria Portela (Department of Bioengineering), in collaboration with Dr Islem Rekik (Department of Computing).

Recent studies reveal over 600 cybersecurity vulnerabilities in medical devices, with many remaining exposed for 3+ years, particularly in high-risk Class IIB/III devices. These vulnerabilities threaten patient safety (e.g., unauthorized device control) and privacy (e.g., sensitive health data leaks). Existing solutions, such as traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), are often too resource-intensive for IoMT devices with constrained power, memory, and computational capabilities.

This project will explore PUF-based group key and mutual authentication protocols to avoid complex public-key algorithms for securing IoMT devices while ensuring patient safety is not jeopardized. The security of the developed protocols can then be validated through simulation, hardware prototypes and if possible, game-based evaluation, tools like proVerif.

You will use a unique multimodal dataset from a macaque brain, including diffusion MRI (which maps structural connections) and high-resolution histology (e.g. Nissl and myelin stains, polarised light imaging) that captures microstructural features such as cell density, layer thickness, and fibre orientation.

The aim is to develop a quantitative analysis framework that:
- Measures microstructural similarity between brain regions
- Links this to connectivity strength and distance
- Tests whether similarity is greater within networks (supporting redundancy), or systematically different between networks (supporting computational specialisation)

You may also explore whether these patterns follow smooth microstructural gradients across the brain or reflect discrete network boundaries.

This project will involve biomedical image analysis, feature extraction from multimodal imaging, and applying computational models to study brain structure‚Äìfunction relationships. It is ideal for students interested in neuroimaging and computational neuroscience."

This includes growing crops and growing feed for livestock. Traditional agriculture contributes 37% of global greenhouse gas emissions and places significant burden on the environment as vast amounts of arable land and fresh water are used. To mitigate this looming crisis, microbial fermentations using bacteria, yeast or fungi have emerged as a more sustainable way for food production. 
Hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria (HOBs) are specifically interesting for food production as they can use carbon dioxide from air as carbon feedstock. Thus, any food production process based on these gram-negative bacteria would not rely on agriculture. However, to use these organisms for bioprocessing, significant knowledge gaps in physiology, culturing and genetic engineering need to be addressed. 
This project aims to study growth requirements and genetic engineering capacities of several Xanthobacter species.

This is a microfluidics project about studying blood flow in microvascular disease. You will build and test a microfluidic device and develop interdisciplinary skills in microfabrication, cell work and microscopy.

BACKGROUND

Blood flows through a branching network, reaching microvessels smaller than a hair in order to deliver oxygen to all cells in the body. In diseases such as diabetes and malaria, the microvessels do not get enough blood or leak, with consequences such as blindness, liver disease and even death. 

Proper function of microvessels is dependent on the blood flowing in them, which is made up of approximately equal portions of plasma and red blood cells (RBCs). These specialist cells have fascinating behaviours: they are highly deformable which makes them move away from vessel/channel walls, and they aggregate (stick together) in regions of low shear stress. 

Previous work in the vBS lab has shown that these behaviours change how blood flows, and in turn affects microvessel function. To study how this process might be affected by diabetes,, we need a model of a blood vessel that replicates its structure, function, and interaction with red blood cells.

PROJECT DETAILS

This project will build upon existing work and involve creating a microfluidic chip that models a small blood vessel within a hydrogel and that can be perfused with healthy and diabetic-like red blood cells. You will learn how to run biological assays to examine the effect of blood flow on vascular cells. You will build skills in microfabrication, cell culture, and fluid mechanics, and have the chance to contribute to our research.

This is a hands-on experimental project about a device to measure hydraulic conductivity of monolayers of cells. Based on an existing design concept, you will build the control, optimise the design and test the system, and learn skills such as microfabrication, flow control and image processing. 

BACKGROUND AND AIMS

Diabetic macular edema is a buildup of fluid in the macula, the region of the retina where the most sensitive parts of vision are located. The fluid leaks from blood vessels due to dysfunction of the blood-retinal barrier, which normally inhibits fluid transport out of the blood vessels. 
The main treatment for this is regular injections of anti-VEGF, which helps to improve the function of the barrier. The process of having injections in the eye is extremely unpleasant for the patient and burdensome for the healthcare system. Further, a proportion of patients do not respond, or respond poorly to this treatment, requiring more frequent injections. 
Alternative treatments and/or combinations of them are being developed and can work for some patients, but require a trial-and-error approach to identify what will work best for an individual. 

It has been demonstrated that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be differentiated into endothelial cells, and used to predict ‚Äòresponders‚Äô vs ‚Äònon-responders‚Äô. However, their study only measured electrical impedance of the cell layer, a very indirect measurement of hydraulic conductivity.

Inspired by this, we aim to build a screening platform to we can measure hydraulic conductivity of endothelial cell monolayers in a parallelised microfluidic device. We have a well-developed design concept for a previous project (with a different application), but the system needs to be programmed, optimised and tested. 

Our clinical collaborators and King‚Äôs College and Central Middlesex Hospital will advise to help the project proceed with the translational application in mind.   


WHAT YOU WILL LEARN

The development phase of the project will use hardware coding, optics, microfluidics, pressure control and image processing. Then we will incorporate cells into the device and test with substances known to change barrier function.

Proper function of microvessels is dependent on the blood flowing in them, which is made up of approximately equal portions of plasma and red blood cells (RBCs). These specialist cells are highly deformable, which is critical for them to fit through capillaries with diameters that are smaller than the RBCs.  In diabetes, RBCs become less deformable, which changes the flow, but it remains unclear exactly how.   
To investigate this, we need a model of a capillary network that mimics in vivo topology. We can perfuse these with RBCs from healthy volunteers, and RBCs that have been chemically modified to mimic the changes that occur in diabetes. We are specifically interested in whether there are blocking events, changes in how fast the RBCs flow in each vessel and whether parts of the network receive fewer RBCs. All of these could have important implications for oxygen delivery.  
PROJECT DETAILS
This project will involve designing, evaluating, and optimising a method to fabricate a microfluidic model as close to reality as possible. Once the model has been developed, a flow control system will be developed and used to perfuse healthy and chemically stiffened cells through it. This will provide important insight into how the loss of deformability affects the flow through the network.

This is a design project about developing a practical way to measure blood viscosity, which has potential as a biomarker for many conditions. You will design, build and test a device, and learn skills such as microfabrication, flow control, image analysis and processing of blood samples. 

BACKGROUND

Blood flows through a branching network, reaching microvessels smaller than a hair in order to deliver oxygen to all cells in the body. In diseases such as diabetes and malaria, the microvessels do not get enough blood or leak, with consequences such as blindness, liver disease and even death. 

Proper function of microvessels is dependent on the blood flowing in them. Blood is made up of approximately equal portions of plasma and red blood cells. These specialist cells are highly deformable so that they can fit through capillaries and reversibly aggregate in regions of low shear stress. Together these behaviours give blood complex rheological characteristics.
Blood viscosity is dependent on red blood cell concentration and the shear rate, hence to properly characterise a blood sample, we need to measure viscosity as functions of both parameters. 

We have multiple reasons to want to measure blood viscosity
1.	We have a numerical model for microscale blood flow that can predict the flow of an individual blood sample if we have the viscosity of the blood sample
2.	Blood viscosity is not clinically measured, but has promise as a biomarker. An easy-to-use device will  
3.	We modify healthy blood samples to mimic diseased blood and carry out flow experiments. We want to characterise how these modifications have affected the viscosity 
4.	Blood viscosity is not clinically measured, but has promise as a biomarker. An easy-to-use device will make it a more practical proposition for monitoring the blood of patients

Classic rheometers are extremely expensive and time consuming, so are impractical. Most microfluidic devices are too rudimentary to quantify viscosity  as a function of shear rate. No existing devices can automatically separate blood into different concentrations, requiring additional manual processing and increasing measurement time considerably. 
The aim of this project is to design an easy-to-use parallelised microfluidic device that can measure blood viscosity as a function of shear and haematocrit.  

PROJECT DETAILS

This project will involve designing, evaluating and optimising a device to measure blood viscosity, and investigating the sensitivity and repeatability of the measurement compared to a conventional cone-and-plate rheometer.

This is important because being able to structure refractive index on the microscale makes it possible to create true volume holograms, which can be observed in all directions and which are visually indistinguishable from the real object.

The student on this project will be using tartrazine infused into Agar gels to create these volume holograms. By photobleaching the tartrazine in a carefully defined pattern, the refractive index could be changed to whatever the user desires, allowing these holograms to be built up one pixel at a time. And because the gels are made out of agar and tartrazine, they are (technically) edible. More seriously, these holograms can act as sensors, probes, vision correctors and so on.

On the day-to-day basis the student will be creating gels, testing the photobleaching, designing holograms, and ultimately creating arbitrary three-dimensional holographic objects.

A common and painful injury to this structure is disc herniation, where the inner nucleus pulposus is forced through a weakened or ruptured annulus fibrosus. This can compress adjacent nerves or the spinal cord, often resulting in pain, motor dysfunction, or sensory deficits. While treatment can involve physical therapy or surgery, the condition is often associated with long-term morbidity, and identifying structural risk factors remains a key challenge in spine health research.

This project focuses on using a dataset of lumbar spine MRI scans from 450 patients ‚Äî some of whom present with disc herniations ‚Äî to investigate whether machine learning can be used to extract quantitative anatomical features and then to explore their statistical relationship to herniation risk in the patients.

The project has two main objectives:

1.	Develop a deep learning model using PyTorch to automatically process MRI images of the lumbar spine and extract relevant anatomical measurements. These may include disc dimensions, and disc degeneration grade, and other morphometric features that can be learned directly from the images.

2.	Analyse the extracted data to explore correlations between spinal structure and the presence of disc herniation, using statistical techniques.

Unlike previous studies which rely on manual annotation, this project aims to automate the entire process of measurement and classification, allowing for scalable, objective analysis across large imaging datasets. A clearer understanding of which anatomical features are associated with herniation could inform not just diagnosis, but the design criteria for such interventions.

The model developed in this project will need to be built and trained from scratch, offering hands-on experience in deep learning model design, medical image analysis, and quantitative anatomical assessment. By helping to uncover structural markers of disc vulnerability, the work has potential to support earlier diagnoses, and lead to more personalised treatment decisions. The work may also provide further insight into the biomechanical factors that contribute to disc failure.

More seriously, many accidents happen because users are not paying attention to changing conditions or different environments in the lab. Computers do not suffer from this lack of awareness, and by logging everything that happens in the lab and making sure that conditions are as safe as possible, experimental outcomes can only benefit."

But what happens next has never been directly observed. Does that one cell grow faster than its neighbours? Or does it reprogram the local environment to suppress competition? These are not just questions of cancer biology‚Äîthey‚Äôre questions about how cells compete, cooperate, and take over structured tissues.
This project gives you the opportunity to answer those questions using a cutting-edge genome editing system with unprecedented control. You‚Äôll use mouse intestinal organoids‚Äîsynthetic, miniaturised tissues grown in 3D culture‚Äîas your model of the crypt, the basic unit of intestinal self-renewal. These structures are ideal for studying stem-cell behaviour in a setting that closely mimics the native tissue.
At the core of the platform is a precision-engineered CRISPR system designed for subcellular, real-time control. It remains completely inactive until illuminated by two intersecting laser beams‚Äîa method called Primed Conversion, originally developed in the Pantazis lab. Only where the two light paths meet is genome editing activated. That means you can mutate exactly one stem cell inside a live organoid at exactly the moment you choose‚Äîbefore a division, during stress, or mid-way through a regenerative cycle. All other cells remain untouched.
This kind of temporal and spatial precision has never been possible in genome editing before. Existing systems affect whole tissues or entire cell populations, masking the earliest dynamics of cell competition. Here, by targeting a single cell, you can dissect the very first steps of tumour initiation‚Äîfrom the first mutation to potential clonal dominance‚Äîin real time, inside a living structure.

Practical student experience
You will:
‚Ä¢	design and build CRISPR constructs using Gibson cloning,
‚Ä¢	optimise DNA delivery into 3D organoids using high-efficiency Neon electroporation,
‚Ä¢	perform single-cell editing using subcellular photo-activation on a Leica Stellaris 8 confocal and a custom-built light-sheet microscope,
‚Ä¢	acquire and analyse long-term 3D movies of clonal dynamics,
‚Ä¢	use Python to extract lineage and competition data from image stacks.
This project gives you hands-on exposure to synthetic tissue models, programmable gene control, advanced microscopy, and quantitative bioanalysis‚Äîa complete pipeline from molecular design to live-tissue dynamics.

Outcomes
By the end of the project, you will generate a set of time-lapse movies and analytical data revealing how a single mutation reshapes a healthy tissue niche. Your data will not only inform how cancers initiate but also lay the foundation for future studies into clonal competition, niche engineering, and precision therapeutic design."

But what happens when a single cell takes on this role? Can one cell alone create a true morphogen field and induce organised patterning in its neighbours?
This fundamental question ‚Äî whether one cell is sufficient to break symmetry ‚Äî has never been directly answered. Doing so requires precise control over both the birth of the organiser and the ability to track its influence over time.
This project gives you the opportunity to dissect these events using a cutting-edge synthetic biology platform that tightly couples optogenetic control, cell‚Äìcell contact logging, and endogenous fate induction. You‚Äôll use mouse embryonic stem cell aggregates‚Äî3D synthetic tissues that mimic the early embryo‚Äîas your model system for symmetry breaking. These structures are ideal because they retain responsiveness to morphogen gradients but start from a naive, isotropic state.
At the core of the platform is a light-gated genetic switch combined with SynNotch synthetic receptors. A dual beam illumination technique called Primed Conversion triggers one cell to simultaneously begin secreting wild-type Wnt3a and display a membrane-bound GFP ligand. Direct neighbours are permanently logged by SynNotch activation (via mCherry expression), while Wnt target gene expression (T/Brachyury, Axin2) is detected by immunostaining. This separation between physical contact history and Wnt gradient response allows you to map, cell-by-cell, how far secreted Wnt propagates beyond immediate neighbours‚Äîand whether true patterning emerges.
This kind of temporal and spatial precision‚Äîover both the organiser‚Äôs birth and its domain of influence‚Äîhas never been achieved before. Existing methods activate whole populations or introduce global ligands, masking the early emergence of gradients. Here, by controlling a single cell, you can dissect the very first steps of organiser formation: the birth of asymmetry itself, inside a living structure.

Practical student experience
You will:
‚Ä¢	design and assemble the light-gated organiser constructs using Gibson cloning,
‚Ä¢	generate stable mouse ESC lines using PiggyBac transposition,
‚Ä¢	induce single-cell organiser activation using subcellular photo-activation on a Leica Stellaris 8 confocal or custom-built light-sheet microscope,
‚Ä¢	fix and immunostain aggregates for key readouts (mCherry for contact history, HA for Wnt secretion, T/Brachyury and Axin2 for Wnt response),
‚Ä¢	acquire and analyse 3D confocal image stacks to extract spatial patterns of fate induction,

This project gives you hands-on exposure to synthetic developmental biology, programmable cell signalling, live-tissue optogenetics, advanced microscopy, and spatial data analysis‚Äîa complete pipeline from molecular design to real-time morphogen mapping.

Outcomes
By the end of the project, you will generate a dataset revealing, for the first time, whether a single engineered organiser cell can induce a bona fide morphogen gradient capable of breaking symmetry at the tissue scale.
Your data will not only inform how organisers arise and act during early development but also lay the groundwork for future studies in synthetic tissue engineering, minimal systems biology, and regenerative design."

This project gives you the opportunity to build and validate a new class of genetically encoded imaging probes‚Äîbioharmonophores‚Äîin live mammalian cells. These are not fluorescent proteins. Instead, they are small peptides that self-assemble into non-centrosymmetric nanocrystals inside protein shells, generating second-harmonic generation (SHG) signal: a narrow, photostable, and unbleachable optical readout.
At the heart of the system is a synthetic expression circuit: peptides with strong SHG potential are targeted to encapsulin nanocompartments, where they remain inert until released by a genetically encoded TEV protease. This two-part design allows for controlled liberation and local concentration of SHG-active sequences, triggering their self-assembly into crystalline structures that produce strong SHG signal when imaged.
This project focuses on the critical proof-of-principle: can we trigger SHG-active peptide self-assembly inside living human or mouse cells? This has never been shown. Success would confirm that bioharmonophores can be expressed, activated, and imaged in standard cell culture, opening the door to genetically programmable, multiplexed SHG imaging in deep tissues. 

Practical student experience
You will:
‚Ä¢	design and model SHG-active peptide candidates for expression in mammalian cells,
‚Ä¢	co-express peptides with encapsulin shells and a TEV-protease under inducible control,
‚Ä¢	validate encapsulation and proteolytic release by western blot, microscopy, and SHG polarimetry,
‚Ä¢	culture human and/or mouse cells to assess intracellular assembly efficiency and compatibility,
‚Ä¢	quantify SHG signal strength across time and conditions using an existing Zeiss two-photon microscope platform
‚Ä¢	analyse optical signatures to correlate peptide identity, structure, and signal intensity.

An alternative approach exists in the area of ""Active Inference"", where the learning algorithm takes the form of seeking to a) reduce uncertainty about predictions of sensory inputs, b) predict the results of actions on sensory inputs and c) some intrinsic reward that is gained in proposing sensory or motor transformations (such as a change of viewpoint) that improve the performance of a) and b). Currently, the key challenge to exploring these ideas lies within implementation. The goal of this project is to explore active inference using language models that have access to variables and sensory input of some form, and harnessing these LLMs either through fine tuning or in-context learning to explore the principles of active inference, and to suggest mechanisms to implement effective learners in different domains requiring active sensing and control."

One of the most powerful molecular sensors orchestrating this process is Piezo1, a mechanically activated ion channel that converts shear stress into calcium signals. When activated, Piezo1 channels trigger transient calcium influxes, which can be monitored using live-cell biosensors. But how exactly do individual cells encode mechanical input? How do they coordinate their responses across space and time‚Äîand what happens when that coordination fades?

This computationally based project gives you the opportunity to answer these questions using a rich, high-quality dataset of time-lapse fluorescence images acquired from GenEPi biosensor-expressing epithelial cells under shear stress. GenEPi is a genetically encoded calcium reporter that lights up when Piezo1 channels open, enabling direct, real-time readouts of mechanosensitive activity in live tissues. Crucially, the data have been collected under defined flow conditions using a custom-designed microfluidic platform, meaning you will be working with dynamic, structured datasets that closely reflect physiological mechanical environments.

What makes this project particularly compelling is the discovery that Piezo1 activation is not only force-dependent, but also transient and coordinated across cells‚Äîuntil it isn‚Äôt. With continued or repeated stimulation, the system begins to lose its coherence: signal amplitudes decline, synchronisation breaks down, and the tissue shifts from a unified responder to a fragmented, desynchronised field. What governs this transition? Can it be predicted or quantified? These are not just questions of cell signalling‚Äîthey touch on the principles of collective behaviour, adaptation, and signal fidelity in living systems.

Your role in this project will be to explore, quantify, and model these dynamic transitions using image processing and computational analysis. By extracting time-resolved GenEPi fluorescence from single cells and tracking those responses across multiple stimulation cycles, you‚Äôll uncover how shear stress modulates both the strength and structure of Piezo1 activity. You‚Äôll also compare how different flow conditions‚Äîlow vs. high shear‚Äîand cytoskeletal states affect signal propagation, adaptation, and decay. The work will involve building or adapting pipelines for image segmentation, signal extraction, time-series analysis, and population-level synchrony metrics.

Practical student experience
You will:
- process and analyse large-scale time-lapse imaging datasets of GenEPi-expressing cells under controlled shear stress,
- use Python, MATLAB or ImageJ/Fiji to extract ŒîF/F‚ÇÄ calcium signals from individual cells and clusters,
- quantify signal dynamics over time: amplitude, rise time, duration, and frequency,
- develop computational tools to measure intercellular synchronisation, using pairwise correlation, signal entropy, or phase-locking indices,
- perform comparative analyses across shear conditions and treatment states to assess signal adaptation and coordination loss.

This is a fully desk-based, computational project requiring no lab work or cell culture. You will work with already-acquired, publication-quality datasets and develop analytical methods that directly contribute to an active manuscript. The project offers deep training in image analysis, time-series data handling, and biological signal interpretation‚Äîskills with wide relevance in both academic and biotech contexts.

Outcomes
By the end of the project, you will have generated a series of analytical outputs‚Äîplots, heatmaps, and coordination metrics‚Äîthat reveal how Piezo1 responses change over time and under stress. Your work will illuminate how force signals propagate through epithelial tissues, how collective behaviour is initiated and lost, and how cellular coordination is shaped by both mechanical inputs and intracellular architecture. These results will not only strengthen the current understanding of Piezo1 function but also provide a general framework for analysing other dynamic biosensor systems in mechanically active contexts."

Eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that typically begins in infancy and is characterised by skin damage, inflammation, and microbial dysbiosis. Preventative treatments remain limited, partly due to a poor understanding of the mechanisms underpinning disease development. A key contributor to eczema development during infancy is Staphylococcus aureus (SA) ‚Äì a pathogen that exacerbates disease symptoms by producing proinflammatory toxins through its accessory gene regulator (agr) system. 

A longitudinal study by Nakamura et al. found that infants who developed eczema maintained stable SA colonisation on their skin, while those who remained healthy showed a decline in SA populations. Intriguingly, many SA strains from healthy infants acquired mutations in the agr system. These agr-deficient strains were less able to colonise the skin and induce inflammation in murine models, yet they outcompeted more virulent SA strains in healthy infants. In this project, we investigate how SA strains evolve and compete on infant skin to uncover mechanisms that could guide the development of preventative treatment strategies for eczema. 

This project aims to develop and analyse a mathematical model that can explain how SA strains evolve and compete on infant skin to drive eczema development. This aim will be achieved through the following objectives: 
1) Build an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of SA strain dynamics by adapting an existing mathematical framework that captures microbial mutations. 
2) Explore how host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions affect SA strain composition.

The human microbiome plays a critical role in maintaining health by regulating immunity, metabolism, and resistance to pathogens. Disruptions to the microbiome have been linked to a wide range of diseases. However, our mechanistic understanding of how microbes interact to drive community composition and function remains poor, hindering our ability to design treatment interventions targeting the microbiome. 

Mathematical models, particularly generalised Lotka-Volterra (gLV) models, are promising for inferring microbial interactions. By capturing how microbes grow and influence one another over time, gLV models can reveal whether microbes cooperate or compete with one another, provided that absolute microbial abundance data (e.g., microbial biomass per species) are available. However, most microbiome datasets are of relative microbial abundances, which capture microbial proportions rather than absolute counts. 

This compositional nature can misrepresent inferred microbial interaction networks. For example, Joseph et al. (2020) showed that variations in total microbial biomass can lead to qualitatively incorrect inferences, such as misclassifying cooperation as competition. Conversely, Remien et al. (2021) found that if total microbial biomass remains constant, relative abundance data may still recover qualitatively correct inferences. However, how biomass variation impacts the accuracy of gLV-inferred interactions from relative abundance data remains poorly understood. 

This project aims to develop gLV models to investigate microbial interactions within the human microbiome, using both relative and absolute microbial abundance data. We will first explore how total biomass fluctuations influence the accuracy of inferred interaction networks. Then, we will propose strategies for integrating targeted biomass measurements into experimental workflows to strengthen the reliability of inferred interactions from relative abundance data. 

To address this aim, we propose the following objectives: 
1) Simulate synthetic absolute abundance data under biologically realistic biomass trajectories (e.g., antibiotic-induced biomass change, recolonisation, oscillatory variations, and environmental fluctuations). 
2) Investigate inference error when fitting gLV models to relative vs absolute abundance data, focusing on qualitative accuracy (e.g., misclassifying cooperation as competition). 
3) Identify conditions where inference reliability breaks down. 
4) Investigate how collecting sparse biomass measurements at specific time points (e.g., at perturbation events) can help strengthen the reliability of inferred interactions when combined with relative abundance data. 
5) Propose guidelines for when and how to sample biomass measurements in future experiments. "

Nevertheless, these configurations are rarely satisfying as an experimental paradigm; it would be better to move the microscope. This is where we step in.

2) Mathematical modelling of microbial communities and ecological dynamics

With recent advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, genetic information can now be analysed in a high-throughput and cost-effective manner. This increased availability of genomic data has since then fuelled the expansion of its research applications, such as 16S rRNA data in microbiome analysis. However, challenges exist in interfacing such data with mathematical models of microbiome dynamics. 

The model development process generally requires the availability of absolute abundance data to correctly infer both qualitative (e.g. whether microbes are facilitating or inhibiting each other‚Äôs growth) and quantitative features (e.g. intrinsic growth rates, strength of microbial interactions). However, absolute abundance data are not always available in 16S data sets, and even when the total microbial load is determined through quantitative PCR (qPCR), estimates obtained are susceptible to large coefficients of variation across technical replicates. Biological noise arising from variations of 16S gene copy number across different species also poses another hurdle between the conversion from gene counts to absolute abundances. 

This project aims to address the above challenges in applying 16S rRNA data to human skin microbiome modelling. We will first develop a data processing pipeline to convert 16S rRNA data into absolute abundance data. Next, we will use the obtained absolute abundances to model the human skin microbiome, by fitting to a simple generalised Lotka-Volterra (gLV) model. Finally, we will perform a critical evaluation of our data processing pipeline, by comparing the obtained models to those generated from the same data using other computational methods. "

Traditionally, this assessment relies on FE modelling to simulate these conditions and physical testing.

Such general schemes have been under investigation for conditions such as Parkinsons, tremor etc. The ‚ÄúHigh-Pass Pole Shifting‚Äù technique focuses on step (2) of the closed-loop scheme described above and involves timely and clever switching of carefully chosen and adjustable analog-front-end blocks which facilitate the readout stage (3) without sacrificing quality of the target biosignal (which, typically, is much weaker than the stimulation artefacts) by minimising the impact of stimulation artefacts during recording. This project is primarily a simulation project which will investigate the incorporation of fractional order transfer functions in the switched blocks of the front-end and in particular their effect in the recovery time of the targeted weak biosignal in the presence of strong stimulation artefacts. Skills: mastering  simulation tools, fractional order systems and matlab-based processing and analysis tools."

SCONE is a project to record an oscillating microbubble at roughly 20 million frames per second, so that when it does break through the blood-brain barrier, we can see what it is doing. SCONE requires computational reconstruction to recover the microbubble data; the student will therefore be employing advanced data recovery and modelling algorithms to address this challenge. A strong background in mathematics and / or programming would therefore be advised."

This project offers an exciting opportunity to systematically evaluate various muscle activation models using numerical simulations. You will write and run simulation code, fit models to biological data, assess their functionality, and analyze the computational cost-performance trade-offs associated with each approach.

In response to the need for scalable and consistent clinical assessment, our group developed EczemaNet, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based pipeline that automatically evaluates eczema severity from digital camera images. EczemaNet has been trained on images from past and ongoing clinical trials, with performance improving over time due to higher-quality labels and image diversity. 

However, two key challenges remain: Unlabelled or weakly-labelled data, especially from older or synthetic datasets and prediction uncertainty, which is often unaccounted for in standard CNN pipelines. 

This project aims to tackle both by integrating uncertainty quantification (UQ) into a semi-supervised learning framework for EczemaNet. Uncertainty estimates will be used as a feedback mechanism to determine which unlabelled or weakly-labelled samples are reliable enough to be included in training ‚Äî improving robustness and generalisation.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop simpler and controllable polymerization methods for synthesizing cationic polymers used in mRNA delivery. Lipoic acid has been reported to undergo controlled ring-opening polymerization at low temperatures to yield degradable polymers. In this project, various cationic lipoic acid derivatives will be synthesized. These derivatives will be mixed with mRNA and store in low temperature, which can initiate in situ controlled polymerization to form cationic polymers. These polymers will directly complex with mRNA to form polyplexes, thereby achieving mRNA encapsulation and delivery. We hope that this in situ polymerization method can significantly simplify the preparation of polymers for mRNA delivery."

Furthermore, commercial LLMs are now integrated with computer vision ability, which allows a query to contain both images and texts. 

Our group has developed EczemaNet, a prototype novel computer vision pipeline for automated evaluation of eczema severity from camera images using a convolutional neural network. Branching from this work, we are now exploring advanced vision-language models (VLMs) for diagnosing eczema herpeticum (EH). VLMs, which integrate visual and textual data, represent the next frontier in medical diagnostics. Their development is inspired by LLMs trained on extensive datasets that are now equipped with computer vision capabilities. LLMs have shown promise as medical chatbots and diagnostic reasoning tools, making them a compelling choice for dermatological applications. In dermatology, VLMs hold the potential to transform telemedicine by enabling patients to query their skin conditions and infections remotely. By integrating VLMs with eczema severity prediction models, we aim to enhance the interpretability and accuracy of diagnostic tools while reducing reliance on large, annotated training datasets. These advancements could pave the way for more accessible and reliable tools in dermatological care.

Separately, another group has developed another model called ASCORAD for automatic prediction of eczema severity from camera images (Medela et al. 2022). The models were trained to evaluate images of eczema and predict the severity scores of 7 severity signs, namely dryness, excoriation, erythema, lichenification, cracking, exudation, and oedema.
For 3 of the 7 severity signs, i.e. exudation, cracking, and oedema, our datasets contain images predominantly with low severity scores and very few images with high severity scores. We consider these 3 severity signs as being ‚Äúimbalanced‚Äù. There is thus a tendency for the trained model to predict mainly low severity scores. Consequently, we are observing a higher error between EczemaNet-scores and compared to the clinician-assessed severity, for cases of high severities. 

We previously attempted a weighting technique to tackle the training with imbalanced data and observed some initial positive results. We also tried implementing Mixup (Zhang et al., 2017) methods, which produced additional insights. 

This project aims to improve the performance of EczemaNet, building on these efforts by exploring other potential techniques. Furthermore, we will explore class activation maps (CAM), e.g. Grad-CAM (Selvaraju et al., 2017), to improve the interpretability/explainability of EczemaNet. It may help to identify challenges in predicting the severe cases. By addressing the data imbalances and improving the evaluation methods, the project aims to enhance the reliability of EczemaNet.

Rather than serving as a simple relay between the brain and muscles, spinal circuits contribute to the initial stages of sensorimotor processing. However, the precise mechanisms by which this integration occurs remain poorly understood. A recently collected dataset of electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded during dynamic motor tasks provides a valuable opportunity to investigate these mechanisms. The goal of this project is to apply state-of-the-art machine learning and signal processing techniques to decode patterns of neural activity and use dimensionality reduction methods to uncover low-dimensional neural modes. Through these approaches, the project aims to clarify the contribution of spinal circuits to motor control and explore how sensory and motor signals may be integrated at the spinal level to produce coordinated movement."
